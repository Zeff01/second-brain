AAI 132
===

Ronsley Vaz: [00:00:00] everyone's focused on AI and they're looking at, and everyone's reporting as well on ai, they're feeling like they have to implement the newest and greater stuff. But ~at the, at,~ at the end of the day, for the people that we [00:00:10] serve, ~Charlie in particular, ~all we should be caring about is ~how quickly we, or how,~ how more accurately and more effectively and more efficiently can we deliver the promise.

We are making on our websites. So we're saying that [00:00:20] we deliver X, y, and z and transformation to these kind of people. Then are we using the data information and ~the two?~ The school system is a great example of that, right? So we're still sending our kids to school to [00:00:30] study something ~that,~ that we know is outdated because we don't have a better option.

And~ everyone's ignoring that fact that first of all, especially in the states schools are more unsafe than they've ever been.~ They're not really teaching them much. And you know, you're actually sending your kid [00:00:40] to school and with the hope that they'll come back home and they'll come back smarter.

But, you know, you can get that smartness of what we thought was smart for, you know, less than $20 a month. [00:00:50] So there's a lot changing, and I think it's key to. To probably set a foundation here and say, ~well, what,~ what's the goal? And for me, I feel like [00:01:00] for us entrepreneurs, ~ ~we got into entrepreneurship to solve meaningful problems.

So if we are saying that we're gonna solve this meaningful problem, and this is the outcome we're delivering are [00:01:10] we doing everything we can to deliver that outcome~ better effectively~ more effectively, more efficiently, more ethically? Quicker, faster. ~Are you, are we solving for the last person? Because not long ago the, the statement was, well, they're just not my client. Or they just don't get what we're doing. And now you can solve for that person as well if you've taken already taken them on as a client ~if you look at [00:01:20] entrepreneurship as in general, ~the biggest jump is going from solopreneur to entrepreneur. ~~Because from solopreneur to entrepreneur, you bring all these extra elements into it, like operations and culture and process and so many elements of recruitment that come into play that a solopreneur is not really trained on yet.~

~So ~the same goes with AI and the biggest jump from solopreneur to entrepreneurs because we cannot adequately, I. [00:01:30] Express what's in our heads to this new person, whoever, you know, the first person we hire, the second person we hire, we kind of have this ~ ~idea that they should know these things. [00:01:40] So there's this gap or this alignment, it's called the value alignment problem. It's the same thing happens with ai. even for the people that are good at delivery and not good at attracting, convert, have ~been.~ Being exposed to the bro [00:01:50] marketers is a huge advantage because you can now execute that at speed ~ ~being the person you are in terms of being focused on delivery, because you can actually get [00:02:00] some of the tactics that they're using and you know what? AI can help with everything from track to convert, to deliver, to scale to operations, [00:02:10] to recruitment, communication. 

It it just up to you to decide or to actually stop and think ~where,~ what's held my business back all this time. [00:02:20] Where can I go with AI to actually, ~you know, ~go past that point that ~I,~ I've not been able to do before for all those people that are going well, there's~ so many, many ~multiple views of the [00:02:30] universe.

Possible. And if I use ai, there's ~all,~ all those possibilities open up and it could potentially, you know, stop people from executing. [00:02:40] I have a different way of looking at it. ~If Charlie,~ if you like a cup of coffee made in a certain way ~ ~and you know, we both have different views of the world. ~And I said,~ and you said to me, Hey Ron, can you make me a cup of [00:02:50] coffee?

The chances of you getting a cup of coffee is very small the way you like it. But if you say to me, Hey, Ronsley, can I get a cup of coffee? And I'll like, it made like this, do [00:03:00] step 1, 2, 3. The chances of you getting the cup of coffee the way you like it is very, very high. ~ ~So use AI like that. ~You've, you know,~ if you've been in business ~for,~ for a decade you've got [00:03:10] processes that already work. 

Build on those processes, and if you are asking AI to do something, don't give it free reign because just like you and I coming together, talk [00:03:20] about anything, we've got all these ~viewing,~ different viewing points. But if you already have data on what works for your clients, what works for bringing, ~you know,~ leads into your business, what works [00:03:30] for delivering to the clients that pay the money or getting the transformation that you're saying that you wanna deliver to them?

If you already know those things, then. [00:03:40] Use AI and give it the process rather than asking AI to come up with its own. So there's a, ~there's a, a~ distinction there. it comes down to focusing on. What [00:03:50] you don't know and what you don't have versus what you already know and what you already have. And ~ ~the tendency is to stand on this mountain of value and look at the next mountain and go, wow, [00:04:00] that's really cool. And then you get off this mountain and start climbing a new mountain all over again.

And it feels really hard rather than, you know, really like going, oh, I've got all [00:04:10] this value. I already know this. I don't have to start again. I don't have to get off this mountain. I just have to start climbing from where I am already and, ~and I'll get,~ I'll get even better results rather than [00:04:20] getting off this height and starting all over again.

So this is coming back all the way ~to the first question that you asked me~ about if we feel like we're getting left behind with the AI and everything changing, I suppose, ~and I, I,~ [00:04:30] I don't think that business owners should be focusing on how quickly AI is changing. I think they should be focusing on. ~ The, the,~ the business goals that they have [00:04:40] and how can they get that result?

And you can get that result without the new technology that's coming out. Much, much better than ~than ~you can trying to figure out a [00:04:50] new technology.~ if you expect that your clients to hire an expert to help them get where they want to go, then do the same. Like, I promise you,~ if you are just learning ai, there's so much you don't know. ~Like if you've just gotten into what I'm talking about when I just got, I'm talking about the last two years, two and a half years.~

~If, if you are just there and you're still. You know, with prompts and all this kind, like, I, I, I, I feel like there's an element of, to you, to you, what you were saying earlier that I don't know all this stuff. And~ I meet people every week, ~Charlie,~ who say, ~you know,~ Ronsley, I am really good with ai. ~ ~[00:05:00] And then five minutes later they're like, oh, I didn't even know you could do that.

And I'm like, that's basic. That's basic. Like, that is such a, that's fundamental to how AI [00:05:10] operates. So how are you going out and claiming AI expertise when you don't know these fundamentals? ~So there, there's,~ so, you know, if someone's looking to kind of get. Use AI [00:05:20] properly. I think getting someone who knows what they're doing and how it actually works to use it in context of where they are in business.

And that's gonna make a huge difference just in general, just [00:05:30] straight away, rather than you having to find out what prompts are working and, ~and ~it's definitely not about the prompts, it's more about ~the,~ the process or the process of how you get the [00:05:40] result. That's why if you say, this is the framework, I'd like you to apply. 

You get a way better result 'cause it knows what you're trying to achieve. ~ ~So ~maybe you can tell me~ what are you seeing with your clients and [00:05:50] where you think they need most help when it comes to execution. And~ maybe we can chat about what,~ what are ways that AI could help them get there? you know, In business ~that~ I feel we get wrong [00:06:00] is we allow AI to even disrupt our thinking of what focus looks like. ~ ~And I'm asking everyone to not do that. I'm asking [00:06:10] everyone, you already have your focus and ~stick.~ Stick with your focus. Because as a leader, the only thing that you can potentially give everyone is focus.

[00:06:20] Better than anything else, and give them that focus. And then you can up that focus by allowing them to do things that only you could potentially do with [00:06:30] ai. ~So the,~ the best way to get more profitable, more efficient, more quicker, more with where you're at right now to train your people on how to use AI in a way that they can do their job [00:06:40] better. Because if you are saying that you really care about your people. ~ ~Then it shouldn't necessarily be how profitable is the goal. It should be, could I give ~my ~my team a four day work week? ~ ~[00:06:50] Could I train them with ai that they could do all their tasks better, quicker, faster, and could take a day off, ~right?~

Because in general, leaders say we care about our people, but [00:07:00] the actions don't really align ~with with with,~ with the words. So. I feel like rather than complicating the future, let's go for the future that you [00:07:10] already have and make everyone aware of what that goal is. Because ~if,~ if you don't know what winning looks like, ~ ~no amount of strategy is gonna help because you are always not gonna win.

[00:07:20] 'cause it's always a moving target. ~ And, and then you,~ and then once you have your target and you know where your focus is. Empower everyone to be competent and you can today because [00:07:30] you know, AI can just be your sidekick. you know~ how~ we are still treating human resources like. ~Like ~when the industrial revolution, ~ ~you know, we are still ~ ~kind of going, ~if, if, ~if we give them [00:07:40] ai, ~ ~they could get lazy and could not be productive. But what we're giving them AI ~ ~so that they can have a better life.

So they can be more human, not be more machine like. [00:07:50] So. The industrial revolution happened and allowed us to have industry. So because of that, it allowed us to do the same things over and over again. And then we expected [00:08:00] humans to do that because you know, we're still developing the machines and now the machines have gotten smart enough that it can do these repetitive work. talking about the [00:08:10] CEOs that are kind of worried about replacement, ~ the CEOs or.~ The roles that will get ~re ~replaced~ are the, ~are the CEOs or the leaders who don't do these three things. They don't have courage, [00:08:20] they don't have connection, and they don't have collaboration. 'cause everything else can be done, everything else can be done by the machines.

~And if you all, if, if, so you,~ also said at the start ~of this interview~ about how everyone's looking at content or [00:08:30] marketing as ~using as~ a use case for ai. ~ ~That's because ~they're not, ~they're trying. To sweep under the rug the thing that ~they,~ they don't wanna do, ~which is, which is,~ which is need for them to be [00:08:40] brave.

~They don't wanna have, they, they want,~ they don't wanna put themselves in a position that courage is required. So let's hide behind something else and let's use AI as a distraction and [00:08:50] start talking about all the new things that are coming up with ai. ~Rather than that, ~ allow your team ~ ~to. 

Do things themselves rather than rely on you. So instead of you kind of going, [00:09:00] oh, ~let,~ let me take over. ~ ~In those instances right now with ai, you have such a great opportunity to say, well, why don't you look at different options and come back to me? [00:09:10] There's no better time to right now. Ask your ~your ~people to be better leaders and empower them to be better leaders.

And as a result, by the way, it's not about like. Telling them it's more about you showing [00:09:20] them~ what it,~ what it takes. And I think it starts with ~ ~reality, which is, you know, AI is not going away I think in general, when it comes [00:09:30] to leaders and the people that report to the leaders a perspective shift is really important.

And then a shift in. ~In ~application of how you get the same [00:09:40] results. I mean, you were talking about ~us doing your ~podcast. ~You know, ~we've been doing podcasts for like 13 years now, probably longer. ~This is about 14th year. There was a time that Charlie,~ we had seven full-time transcribers on our [00:09:50] team, and we had 14 content writers.

~Right~ now we have zero transcribers because over in the last. Yeah, we've got an AI [00:10:00] transcribers that are really good ~and,~ and as of this month we are not even paying for transcription anymore because it's freely available. If you think about, if [00:10:10] your, ~if your~ job title at one point was transcriber, that really doesn't exist anymore, things are gonna change and I don't want to~ you know,~ put like [00:10:20] this nice veil over things and~ expect and, and ~say that it's not, ~it, it is changing.~ It's changing very quickly, and it's primarily because you can get the result faster, quicker, better. ~ ~So ~ ~why not use that? ~Like,~ why [00:10:30] not Like, really ~ ~make that the focus and then ~give,~ empower your people who report to you. Allow them to focus on that same outcome, because ~then ~if they're focusing on that [00:10:40] outcome, you are allowed to focus on vision. You are allowed to focus on other things that are really make you, ~ you know, the~ the person to lead. the key to using AI really [00:10:50] well as a leader is to see inside us, look at what's stopping us. Look at what our limitations are I'm talking from experience. ~ ~I've put out [00:11:00] over 1500 podcasts over the last 15 years, and in the middle of last year, I think it was in August or something, ~ ~Gary said to me straight up, he's like, dude, you're not, ~you're not~ putting ~enough~ out enough [00:11:10] content. I'm like, what? What an accusation to make. Are you kidding me? ~but then if I sat with it long, long enough,~ what I did as a result of that was I [00:11:20] decided internally that I was gonna become a student of attention for the next three years. Was my goal. So I knew that I was gonna become a student of attention and I was [00:11:30] not gonna abdicate that to Facebook ad experts, to content people, to reels people to all these other people that I have been doing in the past. For [00:11:40] example, I get more messages now that my content is authentic than I've ever gotten, ~and I am,~ and I have to break news to them to say, I, it took me 15 seconds and AI [00:11:50] wrote a lot of this.

But it's true. ~It it, I mean,~ I just wanna be honest that ~ ~it can write. ~ ~So much better than I can write. my weakness was there where I, you know, would abdicate that [00:12:00] to a content writer, which I've taken back. ~ ~And not only have I taken back, I have taken back, created a process and an ai. To then empower my team [00:12:10] to write the way I want it to be written in my voice, in my style, in my X, Y, Z. The second thing I've done is I've always abdicated Facebook ads to others and spent thousands ~and thousands~ of [00:12:20] dollars ~of on that.~

So I was like, let me take that back as well. Let's not be afraid of Facebook ads ley. So I paid a Facebook ad expert like 500 bucks an hour, and I'm like, ~ Jamie,~ teach me [00:12:30] everything you know. ~ ~And ~she ~taught me all the basics and I used AI to apply a lot of the basics. And now we're getting leads. This is all me, by the way.

There's no Facebook ~ ~[00:12:40] ad company. This is all ronsley. And to ~take that back or to ~take that over, I, I was scared because what if I try again [00:12:50] myself and fail, I have to abdicate again to someone else.

But with ai, I could plug all these gaps and I could figure it out, and I could understand and I [00:13:00] could learn. ~ ~So now I have no problem in giving it to someone and tell 'em exactly how I want it and, ~and ~how to achieve it.
