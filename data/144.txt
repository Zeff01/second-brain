Chris Ducker: ~Brother, man, dunno what happened there. I, I feel like I had the right link, but I clearly didn't. And then you sent me the link and it was the same link and I'm like, what's going on? I think it must have been an input error on my calendar or something. Maybe I was missing like a single digital or something stupid like that.~

~Anyway,~

Ronsley Vaz: ~are you chasing fuse? We've got this whole idea about soul culture and everything about how you've gotta go hard and fast to get where you want to go. But~~ my guest today, Chris Ducker, who has been a mentor of mine from afar has written his third book.~

~Actually, I don't even know if his third book. It's probably more than three books. Long Haul Leader is the book and it is, we're gonna talk about the life OS framework because I find that very interesting. Chris, welcome to the show~~. Thank you for making time for me. How's the book launch going?~

Chris Ducker: ~Oh, brother, brother, brother, brother. The book of launch is going good, man. You know, it's one of those things I think, you know, a, a lot of people when they come out with a book, they're really focused on like trying to hit bestseller lists and all that kind of stuff, and that, for me is not a serious component of this launch at all.~

~If it happens, great, I'll celebrate it, but the important part for me. Is that the book gets into as many hands that need to read it right now in their journey. That's the bigger play for me as the author of this book. Particularly it's a very personal book as well. Like I really open up the kimono pretty wide in this book.~

~I tell very, very personal stories and those who have read it early and have gotten back to me. The comments. I got a comment from my buddy who I know, you know, Hal Lro. He text me just literally two days ago. I was hanging out with him in Nashville a few weeks ago at an author retreat. And I gave him a copy and he read it on the plane home and he text me just a couple of days ago and he said to me, man, this has been the biggest kick in the face I have had in years.~

~So, you know, to ha to have. Smart, successful people like that to read the book and say, man, I really needed this right now. This is, this is good stuff. That for me is better than any kind of best seller ranking or anything like that. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~I, I, I totally agree. And, and ~~when someone, you, someone you respect really well or really highly comes up to you and said, I've read the book, that is, you know, that is for me, even as I, I'd feel I.~

~Feel very, very lucky and blessed. And I feel the whole journey of getting to the book and putting the effort into the book and writing the book and editing the book, and that whole birth feels justified after that. But you talk about this, you know, season not a lifestyle idea. You obviously, you talked about how you open up in the book and, you know, chronic adrenal fatigue and I mean, I've known you for a while, I've known.~

~A long time. What made you write? What, what,~ [00:00:00] ~ what was the point where you went, I have to write this book? ~

Chris Ducker: ~it was so 2021 I burnt out pretty hard, like you said, adrenal fatigue. I was actually diagnosed with depression. I was put on antidepressants for a year as well, a little over a year.~

~Anxiety was another issue that I was dealing with at the time. And the really weird thing is that from a business perspective. We were crushing it, I mean, 2021, we were in the middle of the pandemic. A lot of what we were doing in person as an education company had obviously pivoted online. And therefore opened up this huge potential client base that we wouldn't have normally have had for these particular coaching programs and and courses and things like that.~

~And so our revenue skyrocketed~~. I mean, we had an amazing, amazing year in 2021 and the work I was doing. Was really enjoyable to me. Like ~~I love working with other entrepreneurs. I love working with other leaders. It's what fires me up. It's what gets me outta bed in the morning, quite literally, right? So it's not like I wasn't enjoying the work, it was just too much plain and simple.~

~I was overdoing it. And when I hit that burnout and I got those diagnosis~~ I was just like, you know what? I gotta really take a look. How I'm living my life here. Not just the work stuff, but like everything, health, fitness, lifestyle, family you know, going on proper breaks, you know, all that kind of stuff.~

~And that's when I started making all the notes. And I'm, I'm a, like, I'm obsessive. Like I, when I go into something, I go all in on something. And this is all I thought about for like a month~~. Literally. I was read, I was reading clinical studies. On the benefits of hydrogen water consumption in regards to helping our cells to recover and, and reset and all the rest of it, right?~

~And yes, I drink hydrogen water every single day now as a result of that. But it, it was, ~~it was one of those situations I was like, okay, now I'm gonna talk to some of my friends~~ and, and, and my peers and see what the deal is with them. ~~And I started checking in on people. And a lot of people were feeling.~

~Exactly the same way. They were feeling tired, they were feeling stressed, they were feeling overwhelmed. They were feeling anxious. So I thought, well,~~ if I'm not the only one dealing with this, there must be others out there~~. And I started looking further afield, more research, more conversations, et cetera, et cetera.~

~And that's really what brought about the book.~~ ~~So I want to clarify like my other two books have come about before this third one have come about because of nothing but my own experience,~~ virtual Freedom 2014 I was in the outsourcing and, and VA game for. Eight years when I wrote that book, rise of the Eur 2018 is all about building a business around your expertise and your personal brand.~

~Well, I've been doing that for over a decade at that point, ~~and with the long haul leader, this is something that I've been living for the last seven, eight years and recovering from for the last four or five years.~~ ~~And so, just another place of experience, it's personal stories, it's personal takeaways, and the overall message of the fact that, burnout is not a badge of honor. It's a warning sign that you're doing things wrong~~. We have, ~~and as a society, particularly as an entrepreneurial society, I believe we've, we've glorified exhaustion to the point of it being now almost epidemic status~~. And you know, it, it, ~~it's not about how hard you can go, it's about how long you're gonna last~~, and that's the overall message of the ~book.

Ronsley Vaz: ~I mean is~ this is a really interesting conversation for a variety of different reasons. I mean, I've had lots of conversations with lots of entrepreneurs, especially around the psychology ~of the think and how we do certain things and how we do certain things.~ I [00:00:10] feel like in general, I can't tell when I'm tired~ until I'm, or.~

Is there a way that you've figured out ~to,~ to tell when you're hitting that [00:00:20] point or if you're hitting that point? ~Or is there some way to kind of know what too, because again, if I compare growing up in India, going to Australia and then going to the US and going to other places, the definition of what is hard work is very different in all different parts.~

~Yeah. You know. So, have you figured out what it is for for us at what point? Because I can go, I can keep going. I can't anymore. ~

Chris Ducker: This is the thing. A, a lot of the time, almost all of the time, unfortunately, you realize you're burned out. [00:00:30] When you're burned out and it's not the initial stage of burnout that you figure it out because you do power through, you do keep going, and therefore you [00:00:40] get deeper into burnout before you actually discovered, oh my God, like I need to take a break right now.

Like this is. Awful. I feel terrible. And with my burnout, you know, [00:00:50] we, we actually, in 2021, every August we take a one month sabbatical as a family. And I remember going into that sabbatical that year [00:01:00] feeling really, really tired. Now, it was, because again, I wanna clarify, it wasn't that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing.

I was, it was just, I was doing way, way, way [00:01:10] too much of it. And so I remember going into that sabbatical, thinking to myself, man, I really need this break. Like I really need it this year. And when I came back, [00:01:20] I walked into this office, I sat down at this computer. ~This is a whole, you know, first week of September I turn on my computer.~

I stared at the screen for 20 minutes. There are abouts. I turned off the computer, [00:01:30] worked back out the the doors behind me here, and I didn't walk back in for another three weeks. I wasn't ready to get back to work. I was still tired, so even an entire month off didn't give [00:01:40] me what I needed in regards to the chance to recharge and recalibrate from a physical and a mental perspective as well.

And that was what brought about the [00:01:50] diagnoses because I would go to the doctor and say, this is where I am. I'm not feeling good. By 11:00 AM I'm done. Like, no amount of coffee is gonna get me through it, et cetera, [00:02:00] et cetera, kind of thing. So generally, the warning signs of burnout usually come into three major categories.

Number one, it's overall fatigue. [00:02:10] You feel tired. the single cup of coffee that you might have in the morning ain't enough. You need two or three to get through the day, right? ~That sort of thing.~ So just the general physical [00:02:20] feeling of being tired and exhausted. The second thing is mentally, mentally things like brain.

Creep up. You can't remember [00:02:30] simple things that you would usually be able to recall very, very quickly. So that comes into play as well. And then lastly is the emotional side of burnout. A lot of people don't think about this or even [00:02:40] discuss it, quite frankly. ~And, and the big reason why is because I think it's, it's one of those things that's a little rah rah.~

~Oh, I'm so, I'm so emotionally drained. I'm so emotionally tired. Well,~ it's a real thing. And we should talk about it. And us men, we're idiots. We have genuine issues talking about our emotions in general.~ In general, right. So it's, it's,~ it's one of those things where it's [00:02:50] like emotionally, if you don't feel up to a task, ~particularly,~ particularly a task that you feel like you should be called to do, to serve, if you don't feel up to that task.[00:03:00] 

There's a problem there as well. And they're the three big warning signs. Right. And like you say, unfortunately most of us power through them and then we just get deeper and deeper into the whole. And then it becomes [00:03:10] harder to get out. Obviously, 

Ronsley Vaz: you know, that's such a, such a great conversation for so many different reasons because.

You know, for me, [00:03:20] I don't know any other different way in terms of if things are not going according to the way I want it to go, the only way I know to do anything is to work harder at [00:03:30] something or, yeah. Like double the reps or, you know, and, and I'm not saying that~ I've, I,~ I think I've gotten better. Through the years as an entrepreneur.

And I think that's only [00:03:40] because, to your point of hobbies, I feel like initially it was just, ~just ~get out of this hole that you are in and use the [00:03:50] business and only focus on, ~on ~revenue, and then you to a point where you realize, wait, all this is just if I'm not around and if I'm not around. Like [00:04:00] to your point ~on, on,~ on mentally, physically, emotionally if I'm not around in those three domains, I'm kind of useless and I'm making this whole thing a lot worse than it is.

Yeah. [00:04:10] So I'd love for you to talk about the hobby piece because it comes to the long haul. Maybe do the Yo-yo diet thing on our entrepreneur life [00:04:20] as well. You know, maybe ~the,~ to actually have homeostasis as they call it. 

Chris Ducker: The thing is, even when we do take time off, we feel guilty about the time that we're [00:04:30] spending away from building our business.

But the fact of the matter is you shouldn't feel guilty. You actually feel pretty bloody proud. and, Good about the fact that you're taking time for yourself because [00:04:40] self-care is not selfish. It's actually the number one strategy for every leader, every entrepreneur that wants to do incredibly well in what it is that they're doing [00:04:50] business-wise without self-care.

Like you said, we're kind of no good to anybody, and that's why hobbies and pastimes are one of the most important parts of that four step long-haul leader [00:05:00] life os or operating system that we talk about in the book. I'll break it down very quickly,~ so. Four major. Actually, I should say.~ I should say there was only three major components of this framework when I started writing the book.[00:05:10] 

There was the personal mastery side of things, so working on yourself, your health, your mental health, your learning ability, all that kind of stuff. That was number one. Number two was love and [00:05:20] relationships because. I feel that as an entrepreneur, as a leader, particularly, unless you've got the support network and the right type of relationships away from work, as well as at work, [00:05:30] obviously you're not gonna be able to achieve all that much.

Right? So that was always gonna be included. And then thirdly, there was the impactful work that we do, the clients we work with, the people we [00:05:40] serve, the work that we're known for. When we're not around, what do people say about us? You know, how do they talk about us in terms of the impact that we're having with them?

Right? And so that was the. [00:05:50] Framework. There was three parts. That was it. But then when I went deeper and I started researching and I started looking and talking to other people in terms of what they were doing for longevity [00:06:00] in business and life, the hobbies in the pastime started to pop up over and over and over and over again.

And when I looked at things from my own perspective. [00:06:10] As well, particularly post burnout 22, 23 and some of 24. ~This book was finished a good year and a bit ago. You know, it was interesting because. ~I realized actually my hobbies play a major part in my [00:06:20] recovery away from work.~ If I'm not out, you know, doing wildlife photography, which is one of my hobbies, or bonsai, which is another, or painting, I'm a watercolor artist as well in my spare time.~

So if I'm not doing those things, then what am I doing to switch off? And if I'm not switching off, how's that gonna help me or [00:06:30] not help me at work? And so hobbies became an actual, very integral part of the book and the importance of that. And one of the pieces of research that we [00:06:40] discovered, and this was from a Forbes survey, I believe from a good few years ago.

Leaders, ~C-suite executives C-E-O-C-F-O-C-O-O, entrepreneurial leaders, small business owners, even solopreneurs were part of this survey as well,~ that if they spend a minimum of two [00:06:50] hours a week engaging in these personal pastimes or hobbies that they had the ability to boost their productivity in their work [00:07:00] life by as much as 30%.

When someone says, oh man, I wish I could just get more done, or I wish I could do more in less time. You know, [00:07:10] my answer now is gonna be, go find a hobby. Plain and simple. And actually one of, ~one of~ the biggest names ~in financial~ in the financial world is a guy under the name of David Solomon. [00:07:20] Now David Solomon is the CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest companies on the planet, and his hobby is DJing, believe it or not, dance.[00:07:30] 

Stance DJing. He is known as Dj D. Soul actually in as his alter ego. And this guy, I mean, he donates all the money he makes from his DJ gigs and he [00:07:40] gets booked, trust me. And he donates everything to charity. 'cause he need the money, obviously. But the fact that you've got this guy who's running ~the,~ one of the biggest financial institutions on the planet, [00:07:50] he has a hobby.

Why can't you? Why can't I? Why can't other people? We should be looking at this as a genuine. Genuine focus for our life. It's [00:08:00] very, very important. As leaders, 

Ronsley Vaz: This is obviously very important as not only for longevity, but just as how we lead others. Because the [00:08:10] tendency, if we feel guilty by stepping away, maybe we have under issues with having team that step away and there's a whole bunch of issues that sort of [00:08:20] it's a snowball effect.

I'm obviously gonna ask you about AI because when you talk about zone of genius and zone of being competent, right? ~Like, do you,~ how do you see AI playing a role in there? [00:08:30] Because it, it feels like competency is being taken care of by ai. So we can actually spend a lot more time in our zone of genius or even start to do [00:08:40] things from a hobby perspective, like for example.

I've always wanted to have my own servers set up where I was, and it was always [00:08:50] hard because I~ I would run,~ there would be something small that stopped me and ~it would be,~ it would take me a few days to figure out, and when I had, maybe I, it took another few days and it just stopped [00:09:00] momentum. But now with ai, every time I hit a roadblock, I can, you know, get out of it.

I've been in so Many things as a result. where do you see things changing? 'cause a lot of things have [00:09:10] changed since you've become an entrepreneur since you've written the first, second and now the third book. How does AI play a role in this? 

Chris Ducker: I think AI plays an important role. I, I'll be the first to admit [00:09:20] as well that when.

The AI conversation started a couple of years ago. I kind of avoided it. I, I, you know, it's like anything else. I don't [00:09:30] know anything about it. Therefore, I'm, I'm not in a position to talk about it. I remember when NFTs became all the rage and everybody was investing in these digital [00:09:40] images and things.

I thought it was like, this is. Bonkers. This is absolute madness. Like I can understand buying a Rembrandt or something, but [00:09:50] just some digital image from some dude that's made it on the internet. No, this, this makes no sense to me. So I just stayed quiet. Right. And so with ai, I was a late adopter [00:10:00] to this and you actually played a big part of this in all of this, as you know, 'cause you came over to England.

You know, earlier on this year, you spent time ~with my,~ with my mastermind group. You walked this all through. And since [00:10:10] then, I mean, like everyone's, like, we love ai. Like this is exactly what we need in our lives. And so AI for me now is really about me saying in my [00:10:20] zone of genius, that's where I utilize it more than anything else.

I know my zone of genius is writing. I know my zone of genius is creating content to be able to [00:10:30] share to, produce opportunity to be able to get my opinions across, to be able to serve people from a coaching perspective, a mentoring perspective, et cetera, et cetera. And so where [00:10:40] I use ai, I, I would say quite literally 80% of my AI use is in regards to.

Ideation. It's about, I've got an idea for [00:10:50] this type of training. These are the types of people that need this training. This is the problems that they're experiencing right now. And these are sol are the [00:11:00] solutions that I know that I can serve up. Can you help me develop a program that would take four weeks to execute on?

In one [00:11:10] hour a week~ and,~ and help me put together workbooks or worksheets at the bare minimum to get my point across in order to be able to provide the solutions that I have [00:11:20] planned. These are those solutions. Can you help me? That's where I use the AI most, you know, more than anything else, I'm not asking AI to come up with the solutions for me.

I've [00:11:30] got those after 23 years of entrepreneurship. I don't need AI to help me with that. I know how to help entrepreneurs grow and scale and, ~and ~move their journey forward. I don't need [00:11:40] AI to help me with that at all. What I need AI to help me with is to be able to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible so I can get the training into the hands of my clients.

[00:11:50] Tomorrow rather than 120 days from now, which is, might be what it would take for me to be able to work on everything myself from scratch. Right. So that's really how [00:12:00] I see myself using it, at least, you know? Right, right this second. I think as time goes by~ and you're the expert, not me, but as time goes by,~ I think we will get to a point probably, and it's probably gonna be a lot sooner than [00:12:10] we think where ~ai, you know.~

~We get to the point where~ everything is connected ~and your Amazon account is connected to ai and your grocery store is connected~ to ai. And I'm gonna be, Hey, I've got 12 people coming around for a dinner party. I want four courses including a [00:12:20] great dessert. Four. A mix of meat is ve vegetarians and vegans.

Can you give me three different dishes on three different, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. AI's gonna spit it [00:12:30] out to me. It's gonna order the groceries for me. They're gonna show up without me even having to leave my AI platform. I literally feel like it's gonna get to [00:12:40] that kind of point at some point in the near future.

And if that's the case, then we start using it for a lot more than just staying in your zone of genius. But right now, that's what I'm all [00:12:50] I'm all about staying in that zone of genius. 

Ronsley Vaz: It's already here. ~That's already, that's already here.~ I mean, the states. You can, yeah, there you go. Yeah, ~you can~ you can use chat and connect it to their shopping cart.

~I can't remember what they use there. But it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll do the, the, the, the meal planning. You'll pick the ingredients. Yep. And it'll put things into the shopping cart and wait for you to say yes or no on the amount and stuff like that. See this? ~

Chris Ducker: [00:13:00] This is what I'm talking about. This is the stuff that~ I, you know,~ I don't know enough about this part of AI and I, I probably should be looking at.

Discovering more and more [00:13:10] of it. ~I do recall Christmas morning I was in the kitchen with my wife and I sent an audio message to chat GPT saying something along the lines of, I've got a ham, I've got a Turkey, I've got a roast, potatoes, a whole bunch of veg and I want it all to come out at the exact same time.~

~This is how heavy the Turkey is. This is how big the ham is. Tell me what to do step by step. Idiot's guide to Christmas Day, lunch go, and it spat it out to me almost immediately, and we followed it. To the timing, to the letter, and we had the most incredible lunch because everything was still hot. Nothing had gone cold, and it was all perfect.~

~So, yeah, there you go. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Well, I mean, I think that's it. I feel that's the, it's the augmentation and you know, talking about. Hobbies. I built An ice bath here in, in Goa, and I saw you doing that. Yeah, I saw you doing that. That's awesome. And, and after what happened was the waterproofing layer started to swell up.~

~So I actually went through chat, GPT, and figured out how to fix it, to empty the whole thing, get it scraped out, do it again, put primer there. Absolutely no way I would've done it if I didn't have that access to what to do. In what steps. Take a picture and it could diagnose what happened. Then after I did the bit that it told me to do, it could say, it could, it's not, this is not cleaned up properly.~

~You actually need a wire brush to get out. And I was like, holy shit, there's no way. There's absolutely no way. I would've even completed this. It would've just been lying there half done because I ran into this roadblock. And you know, in the book you talk. See, I think,~ I think at a certain point in every entrepreneurial journey or or lead journey, they come to a point where they go, well, ~what behind, or what, what is it that, what,~ what's [00:13:20] the purpose ~of Right.~

How does that kind of come in? Because now there are things that you can do that you couldn't do before. Like, for sure, there are things that I can do now that I could not [00:13:30] do before ~it felt like. Learn it.~ And now I Just have,~ you know,~ chat GPT or Claude or whatever else on one side and just~ you know,~ do the thing on the other side and suddenly done.

~Yeah. How do you see, how do you see the, I mean, just~ how you've come through [00:13:40] journey of, you know, virtual freedom. ~You, you've been,~ you've been delegating. I mean, ~I think that's, this is the, I think.~ We gotta learn how to delegate to ai. ~And you've been doing, you know, you are the king of delegation, really.~

Chris Ducker: ~I mean, I think, you know, the, the,~ the big thing for me is that we want to get to the [00:13:50] point where ~I. We are mastery. I talk about this in the book, but I talk about it being the, ~the opportunity to be able to master every moment and the fact that long-haul leaders really do make ~the,~ the most of the time that they have both at work as well as in [00:14:00] their personal lives as well.

Because I think there's been a big push in the entrepreneurial world about the whole kind of work life balance. [00:14:10] Thing. Right? Which by the way, is complete bs. It's a total myth. There's no work life balance anymore. That ended a long, long, long, long time ago. The moment the first [00:14:20] Blackberry came out, work life balance disappeared immediately because we went from starting our jobs at nine in the morning at our desks to [00:14:30] finishing our jobs at five in the afternoon at our desks.

Our time either side of that was our time. We couldn't check email. We you know, we couldn't [00:14:40] sit ~on the, on our, on the train, ~on our commute, replying to emails and all the rest of it. ~Just last week, I went down to London for a couple of in-person interviews at a studio, and I'm sat there at the beginning of the day, rush hour, I think it was around 7 45 in the morning.~

~And to my left, there was a lady working on a PowerPoint presentation on her laptop. And to the right, there was a guy quite irritatingly dictating some sort of report on financial management skills that he was having to put together. And I just thought to myself, what have we got to like, you know, it's not even eight o'clock in the morning.~

~These guys are like all out already. No wonder. They're all exhausted by the end of the week. Right.~ So I think it's about, you know, learning how to be able to master every moment. It's about the importance of upgrading your batteries, knowing [00:14:50] when to push. Right. And when to hustle and when not to, you know, hustle is a season, it's not a lifestyle.

Hustle is actually [00:15:00] a good thing. I'm not braiding or, or belittling hustle. ~It's a really, you know, hard work is what we call it, us old people. Right? So hustling is, is a good thing. It's not a bad thing at all,~ but there has to be a line in the sand that's drawn. In terms of an [00:15:10] end point for that hustle.

And so the job is to get to that, ~that ~landmark. The job is to get to the end of that project or that deadline, and then pull back and [00:15:20] recalibrate a little bit, hence making it a season. A three month season, or a two week season, or whatever it might be, rather than the normal lifestyle [00:15:30] of us in the leadership world doing what we're doing.

And I think this is the issue,~ you know, the, the, the bigger,~ the bigger play here is to build a business, particularly if you're an entrepreneur [00:15:40] or to help build a business that supports your life, not swallow it up. And so if your business feels like it's a black hole. It's probably time to take a look at things and to try [00:15:50] and realign a little bit.

And our job is to be able to design that business for want of a better term, around the lifestyle that we want, not the other way around. 

Ronsley Vaz: ~I kind of want to,~ [00:16:00] while you were talking, I was thinking about this apart from the hustle culture narrative and the work-life balance narrative, which is obviously rubbish.

There's this idea of [00:16:10] monetizing your passion, right? So this hobby conversation could easily go down the path of, yeah, oh, you are enjoying it, you should monetize it. Otherwise, it's, is it really useful [00:16:20] doing ~how, how? They like.~ 'cause obviously the first thing, ~one of the first~ that someone's gonna ask ~is gonna,~ is gonna go, oh yeah, people told me that I should monetize my passion.

That's what my first restaurant, ~what,~ what a waste. [00:16:30] Because ~I didn't,~ this model's better than, but when I think about it~ how would you,~ how would you,~ would you~ reframe that~ if, if at all. ~

Chris Ducker: Well, I think, look,~ if you are,~ if you are really, really good at something. You [00:16:40] genuinely enjoy doing it more than anything else that, that you've done in the past, and you see a way of being able to monetize that in a way that doesn't [00:16:50] take away from the love and the passion that you've got for that thing, then it's certainly something that you should spend time thinking about and potentially pursue.

I had a [00:17:00] conversation with my buddy Pat Flynn. Maybe a year ago. And we were FaceTiming and we were walking, I was walking around the the Bonsai garden that I have here. I've got about 50 bonsai trees [00:17:10] here. And I was showing some of my prized possessions right to him. And he turned around and he said to me, man, like, these are really good.

Like you should do a YouTube channel. And I said, you [00:17:20] know, it sounds great. It sounds great to do that, but I know the moment I have to worry about camera angles and lights and mics and [00:17:30] editing and all that kind of stuff is the moment the joy disappears for me in my workshop when it comes to working on a tree and the joy that [00:17:40] I get from doing it is more important to me than any amount of subscribers, followers, or views.

~So I think. It's,~ I think it's a bit of a visceral type of decision that you'll come up with. [00:17:50] You know, just because I like cooking doesn't mean I should open a restaurant. Just because I enjoy swimming doesn't mean I should become a bloody swim coach. ~You know what I mean? ~So it's, it's one of those [00:18:00] things where I, I, I believe that it really is a visceral connection that you have to things.

And there's nothing wrong with looking into it if you feel like it's a genuine opportunity for you, but just be very, very [00:18:10] careful that you don't do something you're gonna end up regretting. 

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I mean, there's no way for me to have as well, because I feel like I just love cooking for my friends or love, love cooking for people, really.~

~Right, right. And~

Chris Ducker: ~I got a good friend of mine who's a great mixologist, great cocktail guy. Makes amazing cocktails. Every time I go around the house, I always know we're gonna have an amazing evening of cocktail tasting. I mean, it will serve up like four or five different cocktails in one evening.~

~Like it's an amazing night. Every single time. But I know he would be a terrible bar owner. Like he would be an awful owner of any kind of establishment like that. So he keeps it to his own bar in his dining room, and he enjoys it with his friends. So I get it entirely. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I mean, it's such a,~ it's such an interesting line.

~The,~ the book and your work has sort of taken you down because I feel like. [00:18:20] you're trying to send such a strong message especially in the art world, because a lot work out there in the marketing world or the entrepreneur world is this works for me so it's gonna work for everyone else.

Right, [00:18:30] right. ~And ~and you are actually saying, well, you know, you should kind of look at yourself and recalibrate yourself. And what, what kind of stuff do you have? ~I mean. But I did not know about your Bonsai election and love for Bon size. ~So [00:18:40] what else did, does Chris Ducker do to kind of recalibrate or keep things in perspective ~of where they're ~

Chris Ducker: The biggest thing for me [00:18:50] is being outside in nature. That's the most important And I didn't realize how important it was until I hit that burnout. I've always loved the outdoors and [00:19:00] I'm not a hiker or anything like that, but I mean like being out and about in wildlife and nature. ~When I was a kid, I was nine years old and I remember bringing a hedgehog home.~

~And Harry, it was, that was, that was how incredibly genius of a namer I was for my pet hedgehog, Harry the Hedgehog. As about as original as you can get. But I did, I brought a hedgehog home. We, we kept it in a cardboard box in the kitchen for two days until Harry escaped somehow. I think my father might have had something to do with that and put it back to where he, where he came from.~

~But. I'd forgotten about all of that, to be honest with you. And~ when I hit the burnout part of my recovery process, I was working with a naturopathic doctor~ in regards to lifestyle choices, supplementation, that kind of stuff.~ And [00:19:10] she said to me, ~and I talk about this journey with her very specifically in the book actually.~

~She said to me,~ you've gotta get out into nature every single day. One hour, no AirPods, no podcasts, nothing like that. Just get out into nature and enjoy some fresh air. Listen to the [00:19:20] birds, you know, feel the ground under your feet. Just get out and enjoy it for an hour every single day. It's gonna do a world of good for your stress levels and all the rest of it.

So I was [00:19:30] like, okay, alright, whatever. ~I'll,~ I'll start walking outside kind It didn't take me long. To fall back in love E everything started coming back to me ~and I was, I was born about a 10 minute walk from Wimbledon Common in London. So I spent a lot of time on the common growing up. ~And it didn't take long for, [00:19:40] for me to kind of go back to that place of happiness and, Discovery and all the rest of it. And I kept coming back ~and,~ and telling my wife about, you know, I saw this bird and I [00:19:50] saw this squirrel and this, that and the other. And she said, well, we've got that old DSLR camera that we never use. Why don't you take it out and take photos of these birds you keep ~talk ~talking about?

So I [00:20:00] did, and I did that for about six to eight weeks or so until I realized I needed a much, much better camera set up. So, like I said, I've become a little obsessive, [00:20:10] went all in. And ended up buying a four and a half thousand pound wildlife photography set up. Which I'm now the guy walking around with this 600 mil lens,~ you know, in the woods kind of thing, you know, like this. ~And so. [00:20:20] Being out in nature, taking photos of wildlife, particularly birds, is a big passion of mine now.~ And if I must say if I must say myself, I'm becoming to get quite bloody good at it as well.~

And so, for me, that's the non-negotiable, is that daily walk [00:20:30] outside.~ If it's torrential, downpour, no, I'll leave it and you know, catch up the next day. But other than that, I'm, I'm outside pretty much every day ~and that's important to 

me. 

Ronsley Vaz: ~That's great that you found that, that you, that you found that, I mean, it's such a, it's such a blessing when you find something that you're in love with, that you don't even really care how much you spend on.~

~Yeah. And you keep spending on it and it's like, it gives you so much joy. I, I wanna, I wanna land this plane~ in the book. You talk about every Yes. Is a no. What, yeah. I, I feel like. That's something [00:20:40] that we learn later on,~ in, in,~ in our careers. Sometimes we don't learn that at all. Mm-hmm. I've just conversations with a lot of people who were like, why aren't you saying no to stuff?

And I'm like. I can, [00:20:50] I didn't even know that I could say no to stuff. Right. Yeah. So like, ~what kinda ~what kind of advice do you have for people who are like natural people pleasers or maybe they don't even know they're natural people [00:21:00] pleasers, just know. Well, 

Chris Ducker: that's the believe I'm a reformed people pleaser like I used to say yes to.

Everyone for everything, [00:21:10] literally. And I was working with, ~with ~one of my mentors who's unfortunately no longer with us, a gentleman under the name of Dan Miller. And he led me down [00:21:20] this path of the power of saying no. And I realized the moment I started saying no to things that didn't align or it wasn't the right timing or whatever it was that it [00:21:30] created this lift.

Mentally, it was like having less things on my schedule less stress, less worry, less concern,~ et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.~ And it hit me, holy moly, like, [00:21:40] yes, my yeses are a commodity. They really are. Every time I say yes to doing an interview like this, for example, I'm saying no to something else. [00:21:50] So if my yeses are also nos, how powerful does that become in my day-to-day life, not just at work, but also in my private life as well.

And so we [00:22:00] started looking at that a lot more and ~we, we,~ we talked about this, when you say yes to something, you say no to something else at the exact same time. When you say yes, doing that late meeting at work, you're saying no. To [00:22:10] that soccer match for your boy at school or when you say yes to you know that a prolonged family vacation, you are saying no [00:22:20] to potentially that work commitment or that conference that you could have gone to or that speaking gig you could have had.

So ~it's, it's a not,~ it's a never ending cycle of making the [00:22:30] right decisions for the right things for you. And that's why it's so important. It's so personal, it's so visceral. It's a word I've been using a lot. In the last year visceral [00:22:40] because it means in your very being like deep down inside. And so my advice is for anybody that does have problems [00:22:50] saying no is to quite literally just start doing it.

In fact, actually, here's your permission slip. I'm writing it to you right now. Say no [00:23:00] to everything for the next 30 days. Blanket, no. Everything for the next 30 days and see how light it makes you [00:23:10] feel. 

Ronsley Vaz: Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, ~you should go.~ You should go check out the book. It's an absolute. Amazing read.

~I've read it. I've read,~ I've got a chance to read it a a lot earlier on and it just absolutely, [00:23:20] even though you think, okay, I've read a lot of leadership books, but, you know, you've got to check when you get the book. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you've gotta check out the Life OS framework.

It is [00:23:30] absolutely amazing. It teaches you some really cool strategies that will help you live better and live in the way we've been talking about through this conversation. Chris, thank you so much. For the [00:23:40] time, for the conversation. Every time we have a conversation, it's such a a little loss of heaven.

Thanks, mate. 

Chris Ducker: Appreciate you, my man. Thank you very much. 

Ronsley Vaz: ~Thanks, buddy. That was great. I loved it. Cool. ~

Chris Ducker: ~Rock and roll. Well, you got another one to do. You better. You better shoot. We'll will I will. When are you gonna drop this? ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~I'm gonna try and do it next week, but we're gonna, we're gonna see if we can do a double one.~

~So if I'm gonna give that to the, to the content team and see if they can do this as an audio documentary on psychology of entrepreneurship as well. ~

Chris Ducker: ~Okay. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, they'll go through the content and see how that works, but we'll try and get it out next week. That'd be good. I ~

Chris Ducker: ~mean, literally the, the launch is next week, so that'd be great.~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah, we are aware. If, if not then an email will go out next week and the so will go following ~

Chris Ducker: ~Appreciate it. Appreciate it, man. That's awesome. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~All I've introduced Chloe and you to Evan Peyton's podcast guy to see. Okay. He was like do you know anyone that I was like, fucking Chris would get on any podcast right now, I think for his book.~

~So, ~

Chris Ducker: ~yeah. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Have a, I know ~

Chris Ducker: ~Evan, I've, I've not spoken to Evan before, but I know of him and his work and all that kind of stuff, so, ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~yeah. Okay, great. So I think I've already made that introduction and appreciate that. Yeah, let me know let me know. I mean, you're doing already a lot of so,~

Chris Ducker: ~well, if you can think of anybody that would be a good fit for the message of the book.~

~It doesn't need to be business, you know, it could be. Lifestyle. It can be health, it can be whatever you think, you know, if, you know, if you have an in on a decent show, just let me know what it is and I'll let you know whether I need, whether I'd like an intro. That'd be awesome. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah, I mean, we've helped out a few.~

~The Darren who comes to mind he, he, he is it's called a Darren Ali. He was, zach Efron's, he was with Zaffron in Down To Earth on Netflix. Okay. Was that his, one of his? But he's got a couple of books. One's called Super Life, one's called Fatal Conveniences, which we started, we helped launch and everything.~

~So, that sounds ~

Chris Ducker: ~great. I'd, I'd love that intro. That'd be awesome. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I, I, I, again, you know, I'll make the intro. I just don't know how they, they'll, they'll go through his team and stuff, but you never know what, what, what it turns out to be. I'll also send him a text message and, and let him know.~

~Awesome. And ~

Chris Ducker: ~sounds good man. Sounds good. Alright brother, well look, I'll let you shoot to your next call. I appreciate you having me on and all that good stuff and we'll catch up again soon. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Sounds great. Alright brother. ~

Chris Ducker: ~Talk to you soon man. Thank you. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Bye. Cheers. Bye.~
