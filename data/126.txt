Ronsley: [00:00:00] Hello everyone. ~No, absolutely. Yeah, it was, it was, yeah. Yeah. I'd love~ today's topic is really on OpenAI's operator and deep research. ~And I've been doing some really cool testing and holy shit.~

~So every time I come to these, I was like, I'm like, ~Oh, I'm going to show you something cool. Today is something like [00:00:10] ridiculously bonkers. ~So what I'd love is maybe what you know so far, if you've used it, does anyone have a chat GPT pro account? I think it is, is what you need to use. And has anyone heard of operator or deep research?~

~If you could. Unmute yourself. I'd love to hear hear your voice. Give me some feedback before I just start jabbering away. I mean, we, we use the~ we have the teams account for the company. So everybody uses that, but I don't think it has deep research in the teams version. So I was looking at just upgrading to pro to play with it, but I I don't think [00:00:20] they've opened it up. 

That feature to the teams yet. So so I don't know how that works between the two. I think we have to ~switch ~switch accounts or something like that in order to do the ~pro. I'm not sure. Yeah,~ I'd love to know what the teams look like. Because ~I was, I've been,~ [00:00:30] I was debating because ~we've got. We've got pro account.~

~We've got like three pro accounts. Sorry.~ We've got three plus accounts of pro account. We've got Claude pro accounts. We've got a Gemini pro accounts. We've got perplexity pro accounts. And [00:00:40] I never really got into the teams cause I was wondering whether it was useful. How are you finding it? ~Cause we've just got multiple.~

~Plus accounts rather than, you know, teams with, ~is that useful for, for team? It is because, well, a centralised billing is nice because what happened was [00:00:50] I'm still fighting because we had a bunch of plus accounts on people's credit cards and that we're still trying to get them all closed. And because they're all separate billing.

So we now with team, we could centralise the billing and then we could [00:01:00] just add out, we just add licenses, people, and then it just goes into one billing. So it's easy to manage that way. And you also could see if people are using it. ~You know, and then that kind of thing, ~but I think ~it's,~ it's basically the same as plus just in a team, but you also [00:01:10] can create your own GPTs and share them with each other really easily and stuff.

So it's got some other features that are nice. ~Yeah, got it. Got it. Thanks. Anyone else with any input on, on operator or deep research, have you heard of it? Do you know what we're talking about? Have you tried it~

~team? I wasn't loved as a kid, so any interaction would be great.~

~No, for me. No, okay, that's no for everyone. I've heard of it, but I haven't used it or tried it. I've heard about it and how it's supposed to work, but I haven't seen it or tried it myself. Okay. Okay, cool. Just so that I know where to begin, so let me just share my screen and. I am obviously in India right now.~

~A lot of you who have attended the past sessions know that I'm here next week. I'll be in London and I think~ what's interesting ~with, with ~with chat GPT is that there's obviously [00:01:20] some features available only to us. So what I have done is right now I am connected to a VPN and it kind of thinks that I'm in the States.

So that's how. Operators [00:01:30] working for me. ~So if you get an account, if you're not in this,~ if you're not in the States and you're like, Oh, should I get a 200 account? Is it worth it? It's worth it. If you have a VPN because you can use [00:01:40] operator, but I think deep research for sure is available without the VPN.

~So irrespective of where you're at, I think, sorry, not irrespective of where you're at. ~~I feel Europe still doesn't have it. I'll find out next week. Australia, Canada, U. S. Definitely has deep research.~~ But ~~today, we'll talk about two things. We'll talk about operator and we'll talk about deep research and, and I got to say, while operators cool, deep research will definitely make risk research assistance obsolate.~

~And I'm not even, it's not even I'm not, it's not even. That's not even an over exaggeration.~~ ~~I feel that's like something that's going to happen really soon.~~ And I wrote a thesis. So I know what, what, what it goes into what goes into doing literature review or research before you write a thesis.~

~So it's like. This just takes all that out of, out of the equation. ~So first this is the website that you go to, openai. com. Just look for operator ~is what you're looking for, but this is the, the, the website.~ And it'll show you, [00:01:50] basically tell you what operator is all about. And this is what has been making ~ ~the big headlines.

One thing to really know is that everyone's talking about agents. I saw someone, ~a really good friend of mine, by the way, yesterday~ on his [00:02:00] story say, Oh, we made three agents in 25 minutes. You are not making agents. You're making an AI that does a task. An agent [00:02:10] is hands off, independent, does its thing, comes back, it's like a team member that you can just tell, can you go and do this?

And it does that. An agent is [00:02:20] not what people are calling. I think the marketing ploy right now is like everyone's calling these new names and people are buying stuff. So just be aware of that. The thing about Operator and [00:02:30] Operator did exist. ~ ~So Claude Anthropic actually released a version of this, ~ ~and I tested it.

It was great before, but it was very, very tech heavy, so it was not [00:02:40] easy to use. So instead of reading all this, and you can go and read all this if you want, but if you go to operator, chatgpt. com ~is the link for you to go to.~ And this is what it looks like. It looks very [00:02:50] similar, but it's an entirely different interface.

It's got none of the earlier things ~that ~that you have in ChatGPT, so it's got an entirely different interface. So in here you can do a bunch of different things, specifically like [00:03:00] dining, delivery, and very specific, obviously, to the U. S., because of delivery and other things, local services. Shopping, travel news, ~but I'll show you what I did.~

~Actually, what we'll do is let's,~ let's do [00:03:10] something like

I'm too scared to find out what the latest coming out of the White House right now is ~summarize, let's, let's, let's do that.~ Summarize the latest ~news latest~ in AI news. I'm going to give it context and say, ~these are my,~ this is my audience. Just a copy [00:03:20] paste of who I am. If you don't know about this, ~this is ~we did this ~in, in, in,~ in last month's training where we did IMX who helps Y achieve Zed. That's literally what that [00:03:30] is. And I'm unique because, so I help founders who build something amazing turn their genius into AI powered systems.

People call me the amplifier because I take what makes you special and help [00:03:40] you scale it. We did something very similar. ~but ~it's basically that I'm giving it context and I'm saying, okay, we'll summarize the latest AI news, but this is who I help and this is who I am.

[00:03:50] And if you look here, ~it's actually doing its thing. It's going, it's gone and found. ~It's gone and looked for news ~ ~and I'm my hands are here, obviously. So it's doing it's it's scrolling. It's using image recognition ~ ~to find [00:04:00] where it should click. It's reading. It's doing all this at the same time ~ ~while I'm so, you know, I don't have to do anything.

So, on the left hand side here, it [00:04:10] went, all right, the latest news ~from ~from the access highlights is that 3. Which actually is creating a lot of news around the world, ~primarily because. ~~ ~Primarily because again, we haven't tested it yet, [00:04:20] but they say that it's breaking ~all,~ all ELO scores and ELO is how you measure human intelligence. 

~So obviously it is, it is right, but ~I'll show you some other things we did at Operator. So I said that I'll be in London next week. [00:04:30] So I was like, well, ~I'm going to be,~ I'm going to be in Liverpool on the 6th of March. Can you find me two tickets to the game at Anfield? And then it did its thing.

[00:04:40] So it kind of worked for 42 seconds and said, I checked the fixtures. There's actually no match on the sixth, but the closest ones on the eighth, would you like tickets to that? [00:04:50] And I said, yes. And then it did its thing. I'll show you what it did as well, because you can, ~you can I think, yeah, so you can, you can ~go back and see how ~it, it,~ it's operated.

Now there are a few things to worry about here, [00:05:00] obviously that, you know, it has control over your browser. But it's very much in like a Faraday cage. In the sense that it only controls that part of the browser, but it went and [00:05:10] did that. And then it kind of went tickets are available with open. So it kind of told me when to register.

Go here. And it did all that. And I didn't have to, like, go and search and find and do [00:05:20] do all that. The other thing I want to show you, which I thought was really cool.

~Yeah, was so I just wanted to find out what was happening because the, the, the, the, the event I'm, I'm speaking at or booking my tickets and they were, they were talking about some they were talking about prices and stuff like that anyway.~ So I was like, Oh, let me do this research. ~ ~So I was very specific, by the way.

I'm going from going to [00:05:30] Manchester. And ~I'm a,~ I'm a Qantas gold. ~ ~frequent flyer. So ~I was,~ I was like, Oh, I wonder whether that would change the input. And here's, what's really interesting. So it started to do its work. And then it got [00:05:40] to a point where it was like, I encountered a capture on the Skyscanner website, which is preventing me from continuing.

~Can you take over? And~ so I took control ~ ~and then ~I and~ I went through this [00:05:50] capture and then gave control back ~ ~to operator. Okay, so that was really cool.~ I thought,~ I thought that they didn't stop and say, Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. It's done. Like, you know, I [00:06:00] got this problem. It kind of went, ~ ~you can you take over ~and, and, and,~ and then I'll take over from you.

So then ~ ~after it took over, it found Qatar Airways, ~which is.~ Which is like, there are lots of flights from here, by the way, but ~ ~[00:06:10] Qatar Airways allows me to use my Qantas code~ on,~ on the flight. So, ~I found that,~ I found that super interesting, ~and, and,~ and it [00:06:20] did that really well. ~So now, also, this is, I'm not in the States, so ~I would assume that someone in the States would find this even more useful because of the other things it can do.

So that's Operator. I think it's cool, I think Operator's cool. I don't think it's as [00:06:30] good as deep research and I wanted to show you this. ~ ~This is like a very famous ~ ~curve. It's called humanity's last exam and we're talking about ~when, when,~ [00:06:40] when do we get to humanity's last exam and you can see the curve here.

~It's, it's, it's,~ it's really stupid that the curve and the quickness of how you're talking about April. 2024 to April [00:06:50] 2025. This is only a span of one year and this is how we went. We've even forgotten that 3 existed. This is [00:07:00] starting from 4 ~and ~and you can see how quickly this has taken off and now deep research is up here.

~So this is literally ~[00:07:10] This is like, ~ ~I don't know. ~I'm,~ I'm blown away. I'm absolutely blown away ~by, by,~ by that. So I'll show you what to do. Go to chat. openai. com or chat. com. We'll take you to [00:07:20] your, ~ ~to your chat GPT and then I am a pro. So I suppose this deep research will come up in here. ~ Now I want to show you a couple of things before I go and do Actually, what am I do instead of instead of that?~

~Maybe we can use someone as an example that's in here So i'm going to just stop that. So can I get any can I get you someone as a hot seat if you don't mind? So what I want need from you is this is who I am. This is who I help This is the outcome I deliver and this is why I'm unique. So if you can give me that, I would love to use you as a hot seat and, and use operator and do some research market research on you.~

~If that's cool. Anyone, anyone up for that? ~

~Come on, boys. Awesome. Nobby, can you put that in the chat if you don't mind? I help X who does Y achieve Zed, and I'm unique because ABC. ~

~So while Nobby's doing that, I'm going to share my screen again, and I'm going to show you some cool stuff.~ Is deep search [00:07:30] or deep research part of Plus? Or is it part of operator? ~ ~It's not part of plus it's part of pro ~ ~and there's a very good reason. It's part of pro. ~Like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. 200 a month.~

~Correct. Yeah, I, I very~ I was very [00:07:40] hesitant to upgrade to pro. And the reason why is you heard this because you were there from the start. I've got so many accounts. I've got so many plus accounts. I got Claude pro accounts. I've [00:07:50] got all these accounts of like, ah, do I need the pro, but as a test to do this webinar and another couple of ones that I'm doing for [00:08:00] Dubai.

I was like, ~ ~I should know what's going on and ~I should,~ I should test it. ~ ~So ~I, I, I just, I ~was like, let me upgrade, let me test it. It didn't even take me five minutes for me to go, Oh, that's why it's 200 [00:08:10] bucks. I was like, Oh shit, that's crazy.~ So let me not be here. Okay. Amazing. But before I, before I get.~

~Anyone else with a question? Yeah, ~in my plus account. It says in deep search. That'll be different than deep research. ~ ~Correct? ~ ~And I'll show you [00:08:20] why. ~So in here.~ So this is 1 that I ran yesterday ~ ~~ ~~ ~~and it was very like, in the sense.~ Now, a lot of people were saying how prompting is going to die, and I don't think that's the case, ~at least,~ at least for the near future, primarily because [00:08:30] it's so important to prompt correctly,~ to know how to get~~ now,~ especially with deep research, because you only get~ as you~~ only get~ a certain amount to do in a month, you can't like just go ham on it ~and,~ and decide to just Go [00:08:40] crazy.

Even though it's 200, there's a certain limit that you can do. I'm not really sure. I think it'll be in that article that I started off with. ~ ~So, you have to be very specific ~and,~ and [00:08:50] because it goes and does all the thinking and ~it's, this is,~ this is very agent like. By the way, again, we're still not at agents yet, I don't think, because there's a [00:09:00] certain way to define an agent.

But this is very agentic like in the way it works. So, if you don't give it the right instructions to start off with, it goes off in a whole [00:09:10] different direction, and you don't want that to happen. So ~I was,~ I kind of went, well I just wanted to find me a hundred ways to improve and grow a video podcast, do this specifically for [00:09:20] my audience, and I just kind of put who my audience is.

~ ~Now the reason I wanted to do that is because I've been putting out a lot of content on AI, and I think people have forgotten [00:09:30] that I still do podcasts. So I was like, maybe I want to, I want to revitalize that because I think they both go hand in hand. with [00:09:40] authenticity and amplification and business growth.

So I was like, I want to first create this article.~ Okay. ~So then it went, okay. Yeah. Before I go out and head in a direction, can you [00:09:50] please clarify these few things? So what's your podcast? You know, core theme. Who's it for? What's the stage? So when, assume this is for any business that has a podcast [00:10:00] for branding, growth, whatever.

And I've given it context. Then it went away ~ ~and did research. And I want to show you the research here on ~the left hand side, on~ the right hand side because [00:10:10] That is crazy. So it went and started to work on it. And then it searched for strategies for video podcast growth. It started to compile ~it.~ It was like, Oh, I don't [00:10:20] think it,~ I don't think~ I have enough yet.

It's searched for more strategies, plotted to piece it together. Then it found these different areas based on its initial research. And then [00:10:30] it went, okay, now I'm going to find stuff from each of these areas. Then I'm going to find stuff about YouTube podcasts. I didn't do any of this stuff. I let it be, and it just did [00:10:40] all this for itself.

And I'm going to show you how that works ~with Nobby's example. ~It went and gathered all the details. ~ ~There's a whole bunch of things. I'm talking about five minutes of work, found 13 resources, and then [00:10:50] it made this. A hundred strategies to grow your business video podcast and literally a hundred ~and it,~ and it organized it pre launch with [00:11:00] sources.

So you can literally go here and go, okay, this is the source, this is more details. ~ And it's like, it's, it's,~ it's absolutely insane because not only did it do all that, it [00:11:10] followed my custom instructions that was inside my custom instructions on how to write. And how to present all this. ~ ~And that is a crazy article for five minutes.[00:11:20] 

Can you imagine getting someone to write this for you with all those links? Can you just think about that? ~ ~That is crazy, ~ right? ~That's absolutely blew my mind. So [00:11:30] then I was like, Oh, that's interesting. ~ ~I wonder if I give it more direction, whether it'll be even better. I don't know. Holy shit. So [00:11:40] I gave it a similar instruction, but I was like, wait, can you please?

Do this specifically from wearepodcast. com. I've released over 350 [00:11:50] episodes. This is where you find it. It can be found on all Apple podcasts or Spotify. I'm sure you can find a hundred ways to grow a podcast only from these episodes. Please be [00:12:00] specific. And then I gave it similar instructions of who my audience is.

Again, it asked me for clarification. ~ ~And then it went ahead. And this time it worked for 15 [00:12:10] minutes. And found 49 sources. And they were all from my podcast. ~ ~All from my podcast. So now ~ ~this is an [00:12:20] article that links to all the different parts of my podcast that I've already spoken about how to grow a podcast.

That's crazy. That is hands off. I [00:12:30] didn't need anyone. ~Now the biggest,~ the biggest gap here for me right now. Is I had given all my stuff away to my team, so I don't even have logins to my website [00:12:40] and ~I'm asking yesterday.~ I sent a message on the team ~on the thing.~ I was like, can I have my logins back?

Because I want to post this. And that's the block. Like, ~can you, that's a, that's crazy. The block was never posting.~ The block was always, ah, it takes so much time to create. That's not a thing [00:12:50] anymore. And this is so amazing. This is absolutely mind blowing. ~So let's do one of these~~ for, for Nobby. So, Nobby, I'd love for you to, Unmute yourself and I'm going to copy and paste.~

~So let's, let me ask you,~ so if you help people manage their money, ~ ~who are these people? So predominantly the [00:13:00] people I'm looking for are more the affluent CEO white collar. People who've got a higher income and can afford to pay the premium for the program. ~Yeah, but this would help.~ So, for example, if you were to create, let's just [00:13:10] assume~ you're, you're, you're,~ you're writing for an audience and if they can afford you, they, ~ ~They get into the program.

If they can't afford you, they can read the thing [00:13:20] and get value out of it. ~What does that look?~ What does that thing look like? Well, actually, I have another program, which is a step down. It's the core functionality of the main program that they can go and [00:13:30] buy, which is on the cheaper end of the scale. So, and the difference that we're talking about is like 300 bucks compared to 3000 bucks. 

So the ones who can afford to pay the ~three, three,~ three and a half thousand, and the ones who [00:13:40] can't afford it can get the core functionality for 300. ~ ~~What about~~, ~what about if they, ~they ~can't afford it? ~ What, what can they, so for example,~ what I mean by that, okay, is you're talking about the CEOs who have disposable money and then maybe [00:13:50] someone below who has a bit more disposable money, but what if someone's starting out to get to a point to get disposable money to afford you?

~Can you,~ what could you [00:14:00] create for them ~ to, do you see what I'm trying to say? Okay,~ so the place that I start with them is I give them a free report. So whenever you're going to do anything financial, you've got to hand over your, your financial details of [00:14:10] income and expenses and debts. So I get people to put that into a form.

It prints out a free report. It says, this is where you are. This is where you could be. [00:14:20] And that basically then ~tells me,~ tells that person, do I want to be in or do I not want to be in? For the ones who therefore don't go to the next step, it's [00:14:30] basically, well, I can see that I can be better off. What do I need to do?

I don't actually give them anything. It's just a general stuff. Spend less than you earn and pay the highest interest at first. You [00:14:40] can't do more than that. ~ ~So you, you said here, ~what makes,~ what makes my program unique is that it was created for women because of women. Did you not complete that or? [00:14:50] No, that, that was basically where the idea came from originally because I was always being asked by women they'd say, I don't want to know about financial planning or insurance or investment.

I want to know how do I manage my daily [00:15:00] money because they were running out of money before running out a month. Cost of living was going up, but incomes were remaining stagnant. And so they were being expected to do more at [00:15:10] home with less money. And you know, that's. In most families that just leads to stress, etc.

So they were asking that question, how can I do more to manage my money and the simple answer was spend less than you're going to [00:15:20] pay the highest interest at first. ~ ~

So, I mean, it's not rocket science. That information's been around for a long time. In essence, what I've built is the better mousetrap. ~ ~So, a budget is the basic mousetrap. [00:15:30] And what I've created is the better mousetrap. ~ ~Because if budgets work, there'd be ~no,~ no reason for a better mousetrap. ~I would encourage you to change your languaging around your audience.~

~Because I would say that that comes through in how you market. Like mousetrap, you know So, think of them as Think of, of, of you being a guide to helping them along the way, rather than trapping them into, you know, just, just something that I noticed in your language. That's, that's all. I don't use that conversation.~

~It's only here that I've ever basically said that. Yeah, yeah. So I don't say this sort of thing in front of customers, making them feel as though they've been trapped or something. Yeah. Help them manage their money.~ So this is something simple, right? ~Can you create, so the reason,~ so you're talking about master, maybe ~I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll talk it, I'll,~ I'll [00:15:40] refer to it as ~ ~on your website.

If you had like this one solid article that linked to all these other places, then they. ~You know,~ accepted your links. And then this [00:15:50] article grew in. So when you search for 50 tips for women to manage their money, ~who before the, you know, that kind of stuff, so for you to write an article like that.~

~It would have taken me a long time, it would, you know, uh, Oh, I didn't see. So I did that without deep research. ~
