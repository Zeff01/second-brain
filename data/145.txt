Ronsley Vaz: ~Amplify ai episode I should check I should check.~

~1 43, 1 44, episode 1 44.~

~In the last episode of this podcast, I showed you the Presu Asian Framework Matrix, and if you don't know what that is, I highly recommend you take 17 minutes or maybe less of your time and go watch that. It is how good marketing. Makes it easy to sell. It's called Presion. It's a note I wrote. You'll find the whole story in the previous episode, but now I'm gonna show you how to do it.~

~I have the whole checklist. We're gonna do it together. And also, if you want this checklist and all the prompts that I use to create this yourself, just comment. Checklist below and my team is gonna get you a copy. So whether you find that on YouTube or Instagram or LinkedIn, it doesn't matter. Comment checklist below and we'll get you all the details today.~

~I'm gonna show you how to do this in real time, and I'm gonna do it side by side so we can do this together. Alright, come, let's learn.~

So just again, a refresher. This is the matrix.~ It is basically how you take your team or your cl No, sorry. It, it, it,~ it basically is how you take [00:00:10] your clients from being in a latent and low trust space to being active and high trust. All the way to [00:00:20] orchestrating ~the ~the yes where their buy intent is high and they believe what you say.

The trust and proof is high. So I covered the whole thing in the last [00:00:30] episode,~ but I'm not gonna go into, into each one of them.~ In the next episode, I'm going to do exactly like this one side by side with all the prompts and the checklist on creating these assets. A three [00:00:40] minute quick win, a calculator and a swipeable checklist.

So if you are in a position where you are thinking ~what kind of.~ What kind of marketing should I create so that [00:00:50] I can sell easier in my business? These episodes are for you, starting with the Presu agent framework that I covered last time, followed by this one, and [00:01:00] then the ones that come after this because I'm gonna show you how to create these assets that allow your audience to actually get results and [00:01:10] also move into this high proof.

Trust area. ~Okay, let me share my screen.~

~I'm not sure why that was muted, but~

~Okay. Let me move this here. Close this and maybe move this here.~

~Alright, team. Just, just some.~

~Yeah. Anyway, let's just go back to Edith~

~New chat.~

~Okay. So the goal for today is to create a framework.~

~Lemme start again.~

~Actually.~

So the goal today is for you to create your own ~matrix~ [00:01:20] pre persuasion framework matrix, where you know what kind of assets you need to create in each of these areas for your [00:01:30] business and how it work for you and your audience and your clients, and your. People and your outcome and your transformation.

So this is how to [00:01:40] create one like this for yourself and your business. ~Let's do this.~

So the checklist, and I'll give you ~a ~a rough idea on how this works, right? The first we're gonna define the audience and then [00:01:50] create the two by two matrix for yourself. Then we're gonna pick an asset. In each quadrant, or multiple assets in each quadrant, we're gonna lock in the [00:02:00] KPIs that determine that asset and what success looks like.

For that, we're gonna define what your call to action is and then track and make sure it is [00:02:10] ethically and safety bound. Right? So let's do this in steps. The first thing is we're gonna create a ideal client profile and a friction clarifier. So [00:02:20] what we'll do first is we'll just go copy this, okay? Now.

~I'll, I,~ I spoke about Edith. And Edith is our~ is our,~

~our~ autonomous~ triage helper,~ intelligent triage helper. Edith actually stands [00:02:30] for Amplify ai, ethically driven intelligent triage helper. So we have our own version of, ~of ~Edith that has a lot of. [00:02:40] Already, you know, our thoughts, our ideas our brand guidelines, a whole bunch of different things. And in, in one of the upcoming episodes, I'm gonna show you how to create, ~edit,~ and edit for yourself,~ I suppose.~

~But~ I'm gonna go [00:02:50] into this little, and we have different versions of that. I'm just gonna ~paste,~ copy and paste. This here. ~All right. ~So here I'm gonna change this to what we sell. And obviously [00:03:00] you do that for yourself. In here I'm gonna say custom AI software solutions . We create AI team members is to make [00:03:10] the business more human.

To allow the human team to do their work easier, faster, and Price points. Your project history. [00:03:20] Now, the reason I'm using edit, which you don't really have to you can just start from scratch and just define this yourself. Look at your project files [00:03:30] actually, ' cause this is already in there.

Use your project files to determine. So that's the advantage of kind of having this. So basically I'm gonna start and you just [00:03:40] fill in your version. And what we're doing right now is we are kind of getting your ICP and ~you're trying to,~ we're trying to get what creates friction. So. It found my ICP [00:03:50] founders of one to $10 million service businesses with 25 to 20 staff who need faster growth and efficiency now, and who control budgets of 25,000 and above.

Right? [00:04:00] Their biggest pain points are they probably have to rewrite proposals that are over 30 minutes. Chase follow ups. Produce content and all this have signals and all this have [00:04:10] triggers, and these are blind spots. Which is basically assumptions that I should check before I go ahead. So right now what it's done is it's created an ICP line, which [00:04:20] is a ideal client profile three roll table of their pain points, and~ a a~ a couple of questions to check.

So the next thing I want to do is I kind of [00:04:30] want it to, use those pain points to create buying triggers. Okay? So for example, tender deadline is in [00:04:40] less than 45 days. Email invite or calendar block mark proposal due. So this proof, right? So what is the trigger? End of quarter revenue gap. Key sales person.

Resigns [00:04:50] marketing campaign launches in 30 days. Investor board meetings in 60 days. So who feels it first? What's the urgency? ~ and how This. Triggers how,~ how there are five concise triggers and [00:05:00] observable proofs and matching calls to action. Okay, that's here. ~Let,~ let's automate proposals so you never have to miss a deadline again.

Run AI follow ups now to close deals [00:05:10] this quarter. Install an AI assistant ~to assistant~ to pick up admin load immediately. So we build all these ais that like just run in the background and you never have to worry about them again because they're just [00:05:20] doing the thing that it's supposed to. Then the next thing~ we want~ is from there, we want to create ~your ~your matrix.

Okay? So just copy and paste this, the buy intent and trust proof [00:05:30] matrix, and just ~hit,~ literally hit that. what it'll do is four tidy sections of the different sections in the matrix. So if you can see. ~My ma~ the matrix, [00:05:40] you'll see Q1 at the bottom. Q2 ~is,~ is at the bottom as well, border authority, and then the Q3 and Q4 is up the top.

So in prime pattern, the audience snapshot founder is curious [00:05:50] about AI, but not feeling the pain strongly yet. The main objection is we're not sure AI is relevant to our size and team proof needed. So they're really in the bottom where ~they're,~ they're latent in buying. Not ready to buy [00:06:00] yet. And they're also low in trust.

They don't know ~who to ~who to trust. Three key asset types are short explainer videos, benchmark PDFs and bot misting posts. The one KPI is [00:06:10] the percentage of content downloads from cold traffic. We already have ~a,~ a AI team member called Scout and it kind of. Scouts out the market signal ~and it,~ and the signals that come in from the [00:06:20] market and summarizes it for Again, I'll talk about that and show you how to do that~ in a, in a,~ in a following video. Then this is for us, right? This will change for you each one of these sections. So in Board of [00:06:30] Authority, the audience is the founder with urgent pain. Their sales have dropped, but they have no prior relationship with us because ~they're,~ they're active in terms of buying intent, but they're low on trust.

[00:06:40] The ~main, main,~ main objection here is why should they trust us? And the proof is what we need is third party endorsements. Client, ROI. Stats, like publish testimonials. The three types of [00:06:50] assets to create here are case study decks, podcast guesting on other shows and, you know, LinkedIn carousels with metrics.

Number one KPI ~to ~track is the number of [00:07:00] inbound demos booked from new leads. And we already have a AI teammate that kind of does this ~. It's.~ It's called radar. And Radar does competitive [00:07:10] analysis and market intelligence, which is kind of cool. So imagine like we've got scouting radar just operating all the time and giving us results.

Again, in the upcoming videos. I'm gonna show you how to [00:07:20] create these yourself. We're moving high into the trust area, but low on the latency in terms of buying intent. And the audience snapshot is that ~snapshot is that~ they're warm network who already [00:07:30] know and rate me or us but they don't feel a fired act yet.

So the main objection is, looks great, but timing isn't. The proof needed is light touch experiments [00:07:40] showing easy wins. Three asset types in this category ~for,~ for us is, you know, pilot offer, invite, ROI calculator. Actually ~, We are,~ we are building a calculator right now on how much it'll [00:07:50] cost you to just do nothing.

So there's a few there that will, that can be used. The number one KPI to track in this area, in this quadrant for us [00:08:00] is the number of warm leads moving into pilot. ~In, in,~ into the proof of concept area. ~And,~ and we already have ~a,~ a teammate that does personalized content generation. So, ~y~ you know, [00:08:10] again, you can create these.

AI teammates that actually help you do certain things. And finally up the top, we to orchestrate ~the,~ the, yes, they're already [00:08:20] high in trust. They know what we do, and they're active in terms of buying intent they wanna buy. Now they're a trusted founder ~that, that con they're a trusted founder~ that actually want to get something done in the [00:08:30] next to 60 days. And the main objection at this point is, will this deliver fast enough to matter? Now the proof needed is speed to value, proof, and a 30 day implementation plan. The three [00:08:40] types of assets that we should create here, the implementation timeline, guarantee offer, and video walkthrough.

The key KPI here is deal cycle length. How long does it take from first call to [00:08:50] signed? And we have Victor, who actually is a deal closing assistant that helps you. So, ~so each~ in the next few episodes, ~you know, following,~ I'm gonna show you how ~we create,~ gonna create each of these [00:09:00] assets for ourself.

But. Again, ~I,~ if you want this whole checklist, just let me know. So, after it's created, the presu agent matrix, the next thing I want is a [00:09:10] score table of the top three assets to create and, ~and, and~ where they fit in. ~So.~

So it's done this really good job of looking at all the different things and said to me, all right, well [00:09:20] the first thing I've gotta actually build this week is this direct deal closing asset. It's needed for urgent prospects. The next thing I gotta build is a case study deck, so ~to,~ to [00:09:30] build trust and compound sales proof.

And the next thing I gotta build is a benchmark PDF, which we already have by the way. And you can find that at scorecard [00:09:40] dot the amplify ai.com. Faster ship captures coal interest. ~We,~ we've got this and it does a whole audit ~on ~on a business. So after you are going [00:09:50] through your own version of this, 

I want you to just copy and paste all these things. So each quadrant define KPI ~inputs.~

~See above.~ And. You know, the team has done a great job in terms of [00:10:00] putting this together in a way that you just have to copy and paste it. So if you want this whole playbook and this prompt stack comment checklist below and a team [00:10:10] will find a way to get that to you. So for each one of those quadrants, now you should have, you know, four short sections plus a neat KPI table [00:10:20] with formulas and sources. So what does it take for each one of the things? So the KPIs and what benchmarks ~to,~ to keep track of. And then what [00:10:30] we want is your style and tone. ~Now I am messaging Edith and.~

~So iMessaging Edith, I just hope this is still working. Let me check audio test. Still recording. Okay,~

~so I. Where am I? Yeah,~ so I'm messaging Edith and Edith kind of has some of our messaging styles already inside her. but what I want are some call to [00:10:40] actions and, ~and ~if you're doing it in your own version, you should be able to, have these, so ~it,~ it'll create call to actions for, what we're trying to create, and then it'll make sure that it'll [00:10:50] create voice and guardrails.

So what I've kind of basically done here is~ is ~given you a step by step way to create your own version of persuasion [00:11:00] and the different assets required to take someone. Who's in your audience from a very low point in terms of trust and buying [00:11:10] intent to a high point where they trust and value what you are doing and also are very ready to buy.

So this is the full, ~the full~ playbook and we kind of [00:11:20] execute them one after the other. And it's done a really great job, not only at doing that, but finally landing up with this voice and guardrails card that says do's and [00:11:30] don't for ~what? ~How I want it to behave what to do, what not to do, what checklist to look at and, ~and ~how to create it.

~So, i. In the next episode I'm gonna show you how to create assets at speed. We're gonna create the bottom assets, which are for audience that don't know who we are in, in terms of trust and proof, and they're also low in the intent buying intent scale. What kind of assets should we create for them?~

~I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna create mine and we can do that together just like we did today. I'll see you in the next episode. Check out some of the previous ones because there's a lot of really cool stuff that we've done. Call to action. So this piece here is a call to action for psychology of entrepreneurship.~

~Hey, it's Ronsley. I'm so glad that you joined us on this episode. Of volume, of psychology, of entrepreneurship. It takes a long time for us to put these together and we hope you enjoy the process that has taken us to deliver this story type of podcasts to decipher what it takes to be an entrepreneur. We have an amazing catalog, back catalog of episodes that you should go and check out, but also we have a podcast called.~

~Amplify ai, which if you Google, you should find, it's about how to use AI in your business as an entrepreneur, as a business owner to scale at speed, but also to keep authentic behaviors of who you are and what you do. The idea is to create AI team members that help humans do their job better, faster, and easier.~

~I'll catch you in the next episode. I'll catch you in a following up.~

~I'll hopefully catch you on the other podcast, but thank you for listening. I hope you can make that a~

~call to action for psychology of entrepreneurship. Alright, finish. End recording.~
