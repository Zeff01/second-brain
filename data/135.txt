Ronsley Vaz: ~it takes some getting used to, but I think everyone's not, no one's used to this time. So it's like just shafi and you in here? Yeah. So who I, I don't know. We'll see how we go. Like, we'll just try for a few, for a few days. Hey, Shafi, we can't hear you.~

~It's all, how are you~

~mano? Good to see you. Hear you. This, this, I tried this because a lot of, like, people in Europe were like, you know, your, your calls are at 12 o'clock or one o'clock, or whatever. So I thought, you know, let's, let's try a different time. So all my Australian friends are like asleep for sure, because it's like 12 and one and two o'clock in the morning there.~

~But yeah, you guys are here. ~[00:00:00] I kind of wanna do a bunch of things today, ~so I, but mainly because it's a small group, maybe we can, we can, if you can just go and if you can tell me like what kind of use cases you wanna, try, then we can do that together rather than me go and just sort of lecture for the hour.~

So if you have any specific use cases that you want to try using ai, then let's chat about that. ~Boys, this is Stefano. He is 15 years old and he is just an AI enthusiast. And we love chatting ai, so actually Stefano's dad and I, and, and and I, we, we grew up together. So, yeah, it's he comes on these calls.~

~It's really cool to have him actually.~

~Yeah, so Manna and Shafiq, like if you have any specific AI use cases you wanna, you wanna cover or go through, I think that would be better use of our time than, you know. I, I just wanted to cover why I cancel my Chacha PD account. I can do that as well, but maybe be more specific to the two of you would be useful.~

~I don't have anything specific. I don't know. I know if you have something specific. Not at the moment. I have to give it some thought. But~ [00:00:10] curious about your thing for the chat, GPT because also like last month I bought the, expensive one and I love it. So if you think there's anything better than that, ~I'm yeah, ~not, not necessarily better ~in the sense it was a gradual,~ for [00:00:20] me, it was a gradual waning away from chat GPT.

So we used to have, four plus accounts and one pro account. ~So we had a whole, and,~ and that was, the team was [00:00:30] using those accounts ~and, you know, that's what, there was so many,~ and then we just stopped using the plus accounts and moved over the Claude.

so that became easier for what we were, ~what we were~ doing and chat. GPT wasn't giving us [00:00:40] the best results. And again chat, GPT's deep research is absolutely amazing, don't get me wrong, but there's a way around it. It's not, I mean, what I'm trying to say is if you can't afford the [00:00:50] $200 a month, there's another way to do it.

Maybe I think. I think I've come across it. So I want maybe show you, ~show show~ some of that. ~Dana and Laura would love to, if you have any specific AI use cases that you want us to cover together for your particular business. I would love to be very specific and useful. So, if you wanna. Put it in the chat or unmute yourself and, and let me know.~

~That would be, that would be phenomenal. Hey Resley, it's Laura. Hey, Laura. Hey. What's. ~So one thing that I still just [00:01:00] can't seem to get AI to really create good looking visual content. So maybe it's just not there yet, but like visuals for social media or [00:01:10] graphics or PDFs, like stuff that's a little bit more dynamic and detailed when it comes to visuals.

Yeah. Have you~ have you~ used mid Jenny? A little bit, but not in [00:01:20] a while. you'll appreciate this, Laura, because what happened was yesterday or the day before one of my things on my list that I have been putting off or has been moved by my [00:01:30] assistant over and over again was moving all our old lipsy podcasts over to Spotify, uhhuh only because.

~They,~ we were not publishing them. They [00:01:40] were still getting views and listings and a lot of them, especially Bon apathy, gets a lot. But you know, we're not publishing anything new, so we didn't really have to pay what ~we were, we were paying,~ we were paying about, [00:01:50] I don't know, a hundred dollars a month maybe, and all Lipson fees.

So then what happened was I couldn't find a particular cover image for psychology of [00:02:00] entrepreneurship. So I was like,~ I can't find it. I, ~let me find,~ let me look, look, look.~ And then I landed up going, alright, just, ~just ~let me just create it. It was easier to make it so then using ai, [00:02:10] I just changed it to this.

~Mm.~ That sounds like cool. ~Which,~ which is it? And then I was like, well, I'm on a roll. Let me just change, amplify AI as well. And I [00:02:20] changed amplify AI as well. So I think Midjourney is ~very, is is~ my favorite in making things. But let me show you some of the things I've been able to make in Midjourney. ~But yeah, like that.~

~Anyone else have anything else? I'd love to be able to like. Be so specific like that and help you out. So, organize. ~So this is all the stuff that [00:02:30] I've created in the past, ~right?~ So just, you just see the different things. Now I think it's a lot in the company as well, ~Laura,~ because now if you see [00:02:40] this.

Which landed up becoming the cover image. I asked for an exploded view of an AI powered brain broken down into its main parts. [00:02:50] Augmented with ai, make it colorful and easy to understand. So I'm being very specific about what I wanted in the image. Are you being [00:03:00] that specific? Yes. And I think that.

Maybe part of it is like I'm trying to get stuff that doesn't look AI ish or doesn't look sort [00:03:10] of futuristic. So if you see these images, right, ~these are, these are,~ because I've added my personalization to them, so that's why ~they look,~ a lot of these look similar. This is because it's my [00:03:20] style image and I've programmed mid journey to be you know, so, but there are some that don't have personalization.

So these are all personalized. But then let me show you [00:03:30] some that are just, and I haven't used Midjourney in a while. I kind of forgot about it, so I'll have to jump back into there. Yeah, ~that's, it's~ I've got another one as well to, ~to ~show you, ~but~ I'm, ~I'm ~a huge fan of Midjourney. I was [00:03:40] working with, ~I mean, you, you do you do ~animations.

I was working with Gar Seamus. ~Do you know who he is? No.~ Gar Shamus is the guy that started ComicCon, sold ComicCon, and then when, oh, you guys are not running it properly, bought it back, grew it bigger, [00:03:50] made it like all over the planet, and then sold it again. he was like, Ronsley,~ I just,~ what I need to do is remove the middle person.

Like I, I just want to make my art. And so we were making like characters [00:04:00] together, like these are just. I don't know, insane characters. Like look at the expressions on them that we were generating, like we were getting some really good, So what are you trying to create? You're trying to say [00:04:10] realistic images?

Yeah, I mean, so I've got clients that do different things. Like for social media for example, I've got a luxury real estate agent, and so I would want stuff [00:04:20] that's like ~I it ~that comes out decent, like with the Canva, ai and some other tools to make it just look like a house with a pool and like a palm tree sway.

So those ones aren't too bad, but every [00:04:30] once in a while, if you look closely, you can just tell that it. It isn't right. You know, like, yeah, maybe like half a palm tree or you're just like, things are overlapping weird or [00:04:40] whatever. Then like for my own children's book stuff, I would love to do characters like you were just showing.

And I think I definitely have a hard time getting it to look just right, [00:04:50] even if I upload an image of what my artist did. But then also it's getting it to be consistent every time, so making that exact same character, have a different pose [00:05:00] or do a different thing. And those are just two use cases. I've got other clients, like in marketing, and so I'd want like a, you know, maybe something that would resonate with people who are trying to learn [00:05:10] marketing, like, ~like~ an infographic or, ~or ~something .

Yeah. Anytime there's text on the screen, it's always a mess. Right. Yeah, it is because they're two different, that's why it's called [00:05:20] multimodal in the sense that it's trying to do text and images at the same time, which~ is, is~ is hard. So, ~so I think he,~ I think what's happening is in general, it's, I mean, it's an [00:05:30] art in itself.

~It's a, it's a,~ it's a trial and error in itself for you to, you know, if that's what I mean. ~I've not,~ I've not had the need to have. That accurate or specific? We've not created, [00:05:40] we've not created images that are, you know, realistic that we've used, ~but but I wonder whether I can show you a previous version of something that I created dashboard.~

This is another place to ~do to, to, to, to~ try images or, ~or ~other things, and it's very, very cheap to [00:05:50] run. If I show you maybe how much I've spent here, just to give you an idea, see January, like 78 cents and that's when I used it hardest, but, it, it's like [00:06:00] use, ~use~ as you go. So it's not really, you don't have to pay a subscription.

It's replicate.com, and then you go to Explore. And on the Explore you have all these different fine [00:06:10] tuned models. So this is the problem really. That's why ~you're not,~ we're not getting the results we want ~in, in,~ in just by using chat. GPT is because, it is a generalized model. If you [00:06:20] want something specific, then you gotta train that model to be specific in terms of the output that you want.

So for your case, you wanted realistic images, then, you know, you gotta have [00:06:30] a model that's trained in realistic images. For example, if you come down here there's a whole bunch of different things that, ~that ~you can do here, right? You can generate images. You use a face to make images, and [00:06:40] there are certain.

Models already here that are very specific to use a face to get images you can use. Like there are models in here that are really good at text as well. [00:06:50] So~ I would,~ I would encourage you to explore this if images are your thing. Don't worry about the, ~the ~bottom view, but even if you go on to generate images.

The, ~the ~flux ones [00:07:00] are really good. ~I can't find the ones that I've done before, but they were really, ~see flux 1.1 is a really, you see 20.8 million runs.~ Mm-hmm.~ It shows you, it's a popular one and it's really gets text to image really well. ~I heard, I,~ our [00:07:10] team has done work on grok. This is Elon's stuff and images seem to be.

Cologne. ~with the name. ~Trees.~ I don't know.~

So the team have been like saying [00:07:20] that they're getting some good results, even by putting in an image and then asking grok to put text over those images or, yeah, [00:07:30] trees. See, it's not bad in terms of what. Yeah, we should never get the, ~the ~letters, the words. Yeah, this definitely looks better. And then I think we can [00:07:40] go make the shock so that it is at the golden. 

that'd be interesting to see whether it does that.

~Yeah, so even it, it's so like,~ it's even getting the golden hour,~ So I think where to go there, it's,~

~that's, it's pretty interesting. But yeah, I mean images,~ I think [00:07:50] these are your option C. This one is very specific to creating models. ~This is also very popular.~ These two are very popular. I~ wonder whether I went into that.~

~Anyway, I was trying to find, I, I did one of a, of a photorealistic podcast and it came out pretty intense that like piercing eyes and stuff like that. And it was, it was, it was pretty, it was pretty intense. Yeah, so I would, that, I would say that for images. Cool. Yeah. Anything else? You're welcome.~

Yeah. The only other thing I can say too is that I've got a [00:08:00] client for whom I do like really long resource guide articles, and so basically we'll pull transcripts of a bunch of [00:08:10] podcasts, like on a specific niche that we work on. So for example, the last one was nonprofit, so he did like eight interviews of different experts in the nonprofit niche.

So we've got. Notes that [00:08:20] he's taken on every episode and ~found~ what he found important. Notes I've taken, transcripts, all the things we put that in. And usually I was using like the pro version of chat, GPT, like the [00:08:30] paid one. And I would say, okay, like write me. An outline for an article. Now let's flush it out.

And then I would use a tool called Market News, which would help me to find like all [00:08:40] the related keywords that I would need to use to really rank high for nonprofit marketing. And I would. Take those and I would then go back to ChatGPT and say, okay, [00:08:50] this is great, but now I need you to incorporate all of these like 25 words naturally and accurately.

And I would give it to them and chat. GPT would usually only [00:09:00] do like 20% of the list, and then I'd be like, no, I need you to do at least 90% of the list. No, you missed this one. No. And it was just like, you don't know what's happening. [00:09:10] Yeah. ~Yeah. What's happening? ~What's happening is. That you've given it so much information that it's gone past its context window size.

So, oh, what it's doing is it's, ~it's ~forgetting [00:09:20] the previous work. Yes. Yes. That, ~that~ it's done. And that's why chat g pd D isn't the tool to use for what you are trying to do. Oh, if I were you, I would use Gemini just because [00:09:30] of the size of the context window that. You can, ~you can ~work with, so if you're using all that, those notes, then you put in a Gemini, you say distill it, and [00:09:40] you say, okay so I would not even use chat GPT in this instance.

I would go, Gemini, here's all the transcripts. Distill, this is what I want. Make [00:09:50] dot points of that. Then take those dot points and go to Claude and write it in Claude. Okay. Because first of all, chat, [00:10:00] GPT, any writing in chat g PT is getting flagged as AI primarily. 'cause everyone's using chat, GPT, so mm-hmm.

~The, the, the, the,~ the patterns inside chat, GPT are now being just labeled as [00:10:10] ai. So if you just use another model's gonna be way different to, you know, what is considered ai, so that, ~that ~would just change that in, ~in, in, you know, in~ a minute. But then, ~but then~ I [00:10:20] would do it in steps. So I would first go here and ~say here's all the~ open new chat.

And then go here, all the files, and then tell it what the files are, and then ask it for very specific. [00:10:30] Encapsulation and say, gimme dot points. Take those dot points go into claude, and then with your, you know, set of custom instructions in the sense, I, I'm saying I [00:10:40] wanted to write in a certain way based on my style.

Mm-hmm. And then you give the dot points, and based on that, it'll, ~it'll, it'll, it'll~ write. For example, ~I've got a, some really cool use cases. Stefano and I were. We went to the beach last week, I think it was yeah, last th Thursday. Yeah. Yeah. And you know,~ Goa has like ridiculously awesome sunsets and we [00:10:50] were at this place that had like lot these rock formations.

So I build an AI ~that would literally,~ so one of the things that ~I'm,~ my team is asking me to do ~is, is do, do.~ Video, like face to camera, short [00:11:00] videos. So rather than just do any random short videos, it was, you know, ~I've traveled, I was,~ I've been in 36 cities in the last year. I went to speak a lot. I just went to like [00:11:10] the uk.

I'm gonna Belgium next month. So the idea was I'm in all these different places. Why not use the place to record a [00:11:20] video, like a short video? So rather than me think, okay, I'm at this place. What's a script? How do I write the video? I just created a, an AI that, or trained a [00:11:30] small project AI here that all I do is say, write me a script.

And say I'm at Hill, I'm at Poland Beach and go that [00:11:40] has a hill with different rock formations and none of them look the same, but it feels like they fit together perfectly. Write me a script and it writes me the script and I literally put the script in there ~and I, ~so from [00:11:50] idea to recording the video is three minutes.

Do you understand what has just happened? That's crazy. Yeah. But it's very use case specific, right? And now because ~it's~ it's got my [00:12:00] voice, it knows what I'm trying to do. I, I've been very specific in how I want it to, ~to ~respond. So I just literally put this into a teleprompter on my phone and I recorded, ~and I,~ and we [00:12:10] recorded, and Stefan was like, I was one take.

And I was like, yeah, that was one take. I had not even read the [00:12:20] script before I read it from the thing. What I'm trying to get at is creation has never been easier, and you can make it in your voice, in your style. [00:12:30] All you gotta do is what are the reps that matter for you and your business right now? ~Does that make sense?~

That would come in handy for some of my clients too. They like don't know what to say, but they wanna do more short video, So to make that would [00:12:40] be great. Make, ~make, make~ them an AI that will just remove that, ~that ~issue. ~ I wanna show you some of the things that ~so I just didn't renew this and now it says memory full.

So right now, ~whatever it see, ~whatever you see is like the free. [00:12:50] Chad, GPT. So the other day. 

and I still used it yesterday and, ~and~ today, and it like for what my small needs were, like Rochelle asked me something about, ~huh,~ how [00:13:00] to wash a particular like, jacket down jacket. So I took a picture of the down jacket and I was like, ~how do, well,~ how do I watch this? And it literally broke the thing [00:13:10] down.

And this is the free chat, GPT. So, when you're looking and thinking about use cases it's, it's a lot more, you know, every day than, ~than, than~ what do you think about from a business perspective? But then I'm [00:13:20] doing ~a,~ a keynote ~for,~ for EO next month in, ~in ~Brussels. And I was like, what kind of humor?

Like one line jokes specific to EO cohort in Antwerp. And I was like, [00:13:30] ideating that. And this was all on the free account by the way. So, I thought, wait a minute, I've actually never had the free account. I've always had the PRO or the plus account. So I [00:13:40] was very surprised by. What I could do with the free account, ~however,~

So as I told you, like, you know, there's a, ~there's ~a method to my, ~my~ madness of the,~ of the~ short [00:13:50] videos. I've got a certain way that I want it to be scripted ~and~ so I just said, Hey, you know, I'm gonna be in, Brussels and at well. On the 16th of April, I need you. This is deep research. This is [00:14:00] actually using the pro account or even the plus.

I think you can do five or six or a few of these deep research using the plus account if you have that. But I kind of said, Hey, this is where I'm [00:14:10] gonna be. These are the kind of videos I wanna shoot. My goal is to experience the place, but also document the content. Can you. Ask me whatever was relevant [00:14:20] and create me an itinerary.

So it asked me what was relevant. I answered that, and then it went and made a whole itinerary. But not only did it make an itinerary, it then told me when I [00:14:30] go to certain places, what content to record.

So these amplifier videos that I'm doing now, it's like, okay, this is the corner. So ~you, you, you, you,~ in the afternoon go to this place, the Grand Palace, ~the grand places, and~ it's got a [00:14:40] story behind, and I just need to put that into the other AI and it'll just spit out this, ~the, the,~ the script. And I, ~and I~ just record that and then it becomes you know, a piece of content that is quite useful.

[00:14:50] So when it does deep research, it is very powerful. And I highly recommend it actually for deep research. So it's done this like absolutely [00:15:00] amazing job of all the days, but then it's such a long thing that I went at the end when, okay, this is great, but using O one Pro, can [00:15:10] you please just create me a daily checklist of what I've gotta do so that I know exactly where I'm going, on what day.

Then I just did that, which is now way easier~ you know,~ for [00:15:20] me to see what needs to be done. But I thought that was quite useful. Or it also asked me follow up questions because I've, got inside my settings or customization, I've got, [00:15:30] here address me as ronsley and always include to the three ~po follow~ potential follow up questions in every response. So here it was like, Hey, ~do you want~ do you want me to highlight any specific local entrepreneur [00:15:40] meetups or coworking spaces that you can connect with other Belgian founders? I was like, yeah, sure.

And then it did that. So what I'm trying to get at is like, ~you know, this was,~ this was like a use case that I [00:15:50] didn't think I would need to use, but it's so powerful. ~Let me show you another one.~

~Actually, no.~ So this is the free version. Okay.~ So I've, I've, I've used. I've used Deep, I've used Chat Jpd free. Okay? ~And I switched reasoning on. So if I open a new tab, I went into chat, like this is the free [00:16:00] version. If I just click Reason on, ~I click Reason. ~And I click search and kept those on. And I put in this prompt my audience at Business Founders, I'm presenting a keynote to an EO [00:16:10] chapter, knowing what you know about me and my mission.

Take your time to understand, the goal to understand the goal only then outline for me what I need to cover that is imperative for them right now, as [00:16:20] well as what I will ~give, what I will~ give them the biggest return on the time spent with me. Very generic, simple thing. So then it gave me these things which I [00:16:30] copied and I went into perplexity.

And inside perplexity, I said help me find sources to support this presentation. And I copied and pasted exactly [00:16:40] what chat GPT gave me. Again, ~this was the,~ this is the free perplexity with deep research switched on. Okay. And I think you can do five of these a day, which is. Quite decent [00:16:50] actually. So then it gave me this amazing breakdown with research, with links, with all these references to the content that I wanted.

[00:17:00] Then I took that and I went into Gamma and I just copied and pasted that inside Gamma and I said, make me 10 slides.

It made the images [00:17:10] and it made the slides. And I'm talking about, ~I'm not even, I'm talking about~ this whole process took like five minutes, and I'm not saying that I'm gonna present this, but what I'm saying is my starting [00:17:20] point was like not a blank piece of paper. ~Does that make sense? ~I love that. Yeah.

So yeah, I mean, ~I don't necessarily think that, you know, you,~ I think you can use it in other places. Now, I just found out that copilot, if, ~if ~you don't [00:17:30] copilot is Microsoft's ai, which is powered by open ai. And if you. Come into copilot and you click Think deeper. This actually does deep [00:17:40] research inside copilot that's free.

So what I'm saying is that you don't need to have the $200 account because you know whether it's worth it or not. There are [00:17:50] other ways around that. This is definitely one of them. ~The one,~ the other one is just the one I just showed you with perplexity and asking perplexity. So if you open a new thread inside perplexity, you'll see here there are [00:18:00] these, you know, three options.

They're really powerful. So deep research does deep research. This is a pro, which is like gives you more sources than the normal one, [00:18:10] and this one uses advanced reasonings. If you're asking it for something complex that you wanted to reason, then use that. So for today as well, I've got three enhanced queries so I can use any of [00:18:20] these.

These are all for free. ~So, you know, it's, it's quite useful, ~one of the things that most business owners miss is, sending a regular update of the industry to the people that are already leads that they [00:18:30] already have. ~You know,~ like that's like the simplest way. To get clients is the people that already know you.

Just nurture, them, and the simplest way to nurture them is to give them [00:18:40] updates that if they had to look for themselves, would take them ages.

~ I'm just trying to get a gauge of where everyone's at.~

~Yeah.~

~Okay. So. Rather than me go off on a, on, on a, on another tangent and just, I had some notes on what to cover. Maybe maybe let you know. I, I either, if you have anything specific that I can cover, let's do that. Or, you know, we can all, we can all leave early. Classes ended. I have a question, Ron. If you look at the, the chat g PT on the settings, how did you set it up?~

~So, it's easier for response and then you don't need to put it in. Maybe I don't have that done yet. good one. So, yeah. Okay. Great question. So, up the top when you have your image there, you'll come onto under customize. And now this customization is, is, is more than what it used to be, but it'll ask you what do you wanna be called which used to not be there.~

~And then what do you do? Which is also very useful, especially for businesses. So I've written what I do and then what traits should chat GPT have? And I think this is how you tell it. How you want it to behave to you, with you. So for me, I'm being specific and I'm saying, Hey address me as ronsley. And then, and the reason it's addressed me as Ronsley is because these two things were not there before.~

~It was only these two boxes that were there in the initial customization. So, and I said always include two to three potential follow up questions in every response because rather than me think. Of what to say. I'm having it think for me as follow up as well, so you can include that. Then I'm being very specific.~

~About how I wanted to respond, like use language that is straightforward, forward and varied and more closely resembles conversational and human speech. This is my voice style, so I'm being, I'm telling it what my tone is, how I use storytelling and humor, where appropriate, what my voice is, how I use metaphors and analogies to explain concepts what my narrative style is, how to use storytelling elements.~

~Then I'm also saying. Make sure you write in British English. And I have to say that it doesn't always follow that particular one because very simply it's, the model is trained on American English, so, it's. Its patterns of very American English. So the, the Z comes around all the time, which is kind of annoying a little bit.~

~But anyway, I'm going avoid using the following phrases and I'm being very specific about what kind of phrases like delve and tapestry and realm and, you know, these, phrases that are very AI like, and then I, I sort of shut that down. And then the other thing that is useful is here. Put in your whole bio.~

~So anything else chat, GPT should know about you. Yeah. You should know that this is, this is my bio, this is my focus, here is my vision and my mission. This is what I wanna do. I wanna reduce human cognitive load. So I wanna put all that in there. And yeah, that is how you customize. And actually you also want to go into.~

~So I think my memory is settings. Oh yeah. So the only reason it's full is because it, it's gone from like pro, the $200 account to zero. So it's like telling me all my thing, the, the memory is full and no new memories will be created and that's totally fine. But go in here in your personalization and see what kind of stuff.~

~Doesn't need to be here. You know what I mean? Like sometimes it remembers stuff that are not relevant. For example, in one of the memories here was something about Ronsley had this conversation about anger, but that's because I was on a walk and I was experimenting and I was talking to chat GPT and I was like, Hey, I want, I can, we have a conversation about how people can see anger differently.~

~We had this whole back and forth about how, you can be angry, but you don't have to insult someone in the anger and all this, this long conversation, it was 22 minutes long, but then it remembered that part and it kind of put that in my memory, which didn't need to be there. You know what I mean?~

~It was just like this one-off conversation. So those things look at and that's pretty much how you. How you would personalize that GPT, but mano, I think you're gonna join us for the 90 days, right? So if, if you're gonna join us for the 90 days, then like, I'm gonna show you how to do that in any AI and how to create like this very personalized AI that you can literally go and ask it things like, for example, I was at, I spoke at this event in in Manchester, and the person that followed me spoke about,~

~ the five stages awareness. I mean, this is like marketing 1 0 1, the five stages that your customer is aware, they're unaware. They're either unaware, they're problem aware, they're solution aware, they're product aware, or they're most aware so they know everything about you. Right. So I just took a, clicked a picture of that and the, the presenter told the whole audience to, they had a worksheet and they were working their unaware, problem aware, solution aware.~

~So I just clicked that and I went, knowing what you know about me and my business, apply that. And it did that in like. A few seconds. So while everyone was like filling out their worksheets, this was already done and it was only because I had that encapsulated and I could ask it questions. So we'll cover all this in the 90 days.~

~Yeah.~

~If someone else doesn't have any question, I have another question. So, yeah, in what way is it possible to make a. AI copy of you. So like when people have certain questions or the ways you help them, AI can answer that for them. And even like they can chat with the ai. Is that very hard to set up something like that where you download everything you normally talk about with people?~

~Because a lot of my work is repetitive. Yeah. So how you arrange that data is important. What, what's happening right now is ~~people are not getting the results because how Laura at the start was talking about, you know, putting all this data in and, and it not getting the right responses because it can't, there's a big difference between search and intelligence.~

~When you search, it's looking for that exact phrase. It's finding that exact phrase, that phrase isn't there. It's saying it's not there~~. If it's there, it's kind of going, it's there. Intelligence is different. Intelligence is not doing that. ~~Intelligence is going is more like, I'm already trained in this.~

~Ask me a question, and then it's giving you a conscious stream of output.~~ That was the first model. The new models, the reasoning models are going, okay, let me think about what you just said. And I think what you said is this, and it's breaking it down, and then it's using that thinking in its output.~

~Does that make sense? So for you to create something of your own, you'd want to know, firstly, I would ask you to do this, write what the result looks like. Okay. Right. What kind of information needs to be there, those results to happen? So, so say for example your repetitive work that you're talking about, what are the use cases and then what kind of material do you need for those use cases to be to be fulfilled?~

~ So what I mean by that is if your customer is asking for. Say it's a customer service. You know, say you're a business coach and you, you've got all these trainings, and the customer's like, oh, I need to find how to do X. What are the trainings? So you would have to like go, okay, my framework is maybe attract, convert, deliver.~

~So it'll either fit in one of those three. Boxes. And if my customer's asking me this question first first find out whether it's in those ca in in those categories and then in those categories what kind of training is relevant for what they are. Then the training will have to be encapsulated and put into an AI so that it can respond with accuracy.~

~ So it's just a process of. collecting the right data and putting that in the right order. So if you can start off with the use case, what kind of sample questions that people will kind of ask, and then what kind of data needs to be put in there. Then in our next session like this, we can then break it down and start talking about how to put it together.~

~Yeah, I. Cool. Anyone else? Anything else?~

~No. Stefano, how you going with Cursor? Are you playing with that? I've been playing around with Cursor more like it's actually translated the whole thing to react really well. The only thing that was a problem was like setting up the whole React environment, Android studio and everything. But other than that, the coding part, it handled it really well.~

~So compiled and everything done, like I have it running on an avior, so now I have to see how to get it on the app store in place, so, so I can do actual tests. So ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know what just happened Stefano was having this issue with a coding issue and there's a, ~~there's an AI app called Cursor, which pretty much does.~

~All the coding for you. And it feels kind of useless that I went to university to learn all this stuff, but it, he kind of just put that in and it wrote all the code for him and it compiles and now it's an app that he just has to put on the app store which is insane. So, talk about how AI is changing the game.~

~Only a software developer prop, like that was the biggest problem with software was, was. You know, if something was not working, we didn't know how to fix it, and sometimes it would compile and we're like, oh, where's the problem? But now you can just put that into AI and, and then, and debug it.~~ So, that's cool man.~

~Keep, keep us updated on, on how that's going and what's the next step for the. But I still have to do some debugging that if I didn't understand what was going on, I feel like there would've been a lot more problems. So there were some areas that have to be specific and plus it's not like I asked it to do from scratch.~

~I had the tablet with the website already, so I just said, convert this to type three. I looked at all the research for how I'm going to run it on an Android thing, but now I've started brainstorming with more ideas with, and if you, if I gave it like the context of like, what are simple ways you could help in everyday lives?~

~And it actually follows that context really well when it's brainstorming. Yeah, that's, that's cool. Awesome. Well, thanks team. Gotta hang out. We'll try one last question. Sure. Is there another tool that does similar to what Chatt PT does with the agents out there, like the. I was testing the, the $200 a month one with chat, GPT, and I was, I had like five different windows open and a different chat agent was doing research and compiling it into a spreadsheet operator.~

~Oh, yeah, operator. Yeah.~~ I don't think operators like functioning that well~~ in the sense that, no, it drove me crazy. So I can't, it's nots. Yeah. No, it's not you. It's not you. It's, it's them releasing something in a, in a marketing ploy against deep seek. Because deep seek came out and they had to like, put something out.~

~They, they put out operator. It's not functioning well. It's not doing what it's supposed to do. So the promise is there, but it's not really like I, I, I haven't seen a single use case that is. Useful yet on Operator, and there's another tool that does similar yet, oh, there is MON minus ai, but again, that's a Chinese company, Uhhuh, and there's nothing wrong with them.~

~It's just that the, the US is using that as a marketing thing. But they're all open, open source, which is crazy. which is insane because O Open AI is called Open ai, but they're not open at all. they're closed. So minus AI and deep seek and minus are both open source, which means, you know, which means we know everything. We know how it's working, we know the training. We know how it's taking the data, how it's using the data, how it's thinking. It, we, we know everything. It's, and, and not only we know all that, it's open source, which means other people are building on all the work that they've done, which is ideally the way we want it to be.~

~But Manas is like that, that unfortunately it's got so much of hype right now that, that they're, it's, it's like invite only and, and I haven't been able to get in even though someone sent me a code, that code didn't seem to work. So, I've just joined the waiting list and I'll have to see.~

~But if you watch some of these videos,~

~mind mind blowing absolutely insane. What is possible? And on, on the same note by the way, I using the deep research tool, I asked it to create me like this. So I said, find me a hundred ways to improve and grow a video podcast. Do this specifically for my audience. This is who my audience is. And then it asked me some clarifying questions and took five minutes.~

~Came out with all the, like, literally a hundred ways purchase versus pre-launch and launch strategies, content strategies production, like everything, A hundred Ways to Improve Video Podcast. And we don't see your screen if you want us to see it. Oh, shit. Sorry.~

~That's funny. I was, I was just showing you a chat. GPT, yeah, so this is using deep research, using the $200 and saying, find me a hundred ways to improve and grow video podcasts. And then give me like, a hundred ways and strategies to grow a business video podcast, which is ridiculous. When you think about how to compile something like that.~

~Then another thing is this is useful. This'll find useful. Laura. Laura, like I then said, well wait a minute. Can I improve on that? I've done already 350 episodes on We Are podcasts. Just use that as your reference. So it then made a hundred Ways to Grow Your Video podcast using We are podcast episodes.~

~Wow. And here is the video. So, so rather than put, release them as a hundred, the team has started to release them in, in, in batches of, of 25. So here's the one on, on audience build audience. And again, these are all previous, previous podcasts. So it's the, tip, and if you want more on the tip here is when you go to listen to it.~

~What the fuck? That is insane. That is insane. Right? And then the second one, which went out last week, I think, was this one. So then I think next the following will be the third one and that, so on. So yeah, if you already have the $200 one, that's kind of a useful thing to do. I canceled it 'cause it was driving me crazy.~

~But it'll get better. It'll only get better. And and, and, and, and the, ~~the inside news is that OpenAI is not profitable.~~ Okay. So they're not, they might be have all these users, but for the amount they're spending for compute. They're not actually profitable, so they need to be in a monopoly to win.~

~So they're trying everything to shut down, deep seek, and these other players in the game. Because otherwise, you know, they, they're not actually a profitable business, but that's on the, on the down low. We don't know how true that is, by the way. So yeah, neither here nor there. Cool. Yeah. Well, thank you so much.~

~You're welcome. I love, I love these sessions. So thanks for showing up team. Good to see everyone. I'll see you next week.~

~Right. Bye. Have a good day. Yeah, bye.~
