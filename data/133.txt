Ronsley Vaz: ~Morning Shafiq. Can you hear me?~

~Nabi Morning. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, I was trying to finish up a call. Oh, all good. It's just us so let's play the three of us. the three of us. Well, maybe more people are going to join. Let's be optimistic. Yeah, be very optimistic. I either way, it's you're the one who gets up at five o'clock in the morning.~

~Ah, what's sleeping in 4 4 o'clock. Come on, get up. I know, I know. I'm, I'm I wake up at four. I, I have been waking up at 3 59 for like 12, 13 years now. Actually, my first business, it was my first business after my first business shot overnight. And I had like a whole bunch of debt. I read a book, I can't remember which book I, I, I know which book it was called.~

~It was called the Miracle Morning by. Hall Ro I think probably. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember, I remember having all these debt collectors and people for coming for the car and the, and the, and the house and all this kind of stuff. And I was reading this book, and in the book he says something to the effect of if you want, if you want results other people don't get, and you gotta do things that other people don't do.~

~And so, you know, it's just been a habit now since that time that I've just been waking up early and it's been a habit. However, I think in Brisbane it's easier because everyone in Brisbane wakes up earlier. It's like a Queenslander thing maybe. I don't know. The sun. The sun, the sun comes up earlier in Brisbane.~

~I don't know. In India it's very different. The sun doesn't come up earlier in Brisbane, it comes up earlier in Melbourne. So I'm up at four o'clock here. When you are getting up at four o'clock or or whatever there, it's already five o'clock. I've already done. Now's work. It's a daylight savings, isn't it?~

~Yeah. Yeah. Which will end in a couple of weeks, unfortunately or fortunately, I noticed that when I was working that by about quarter past five, it was getting light and I thought, oh, this is great. And of course now it's getting closer to like seven o'clock before it starts getting light, which is a shame.~

~Yeah, I think that's so I, I actually really miss Brisbane 'cause of that 'cause I feel my body clock really light that, you know, early to bed, sort of early to rise sort of thing. Here in, in India it's the exact opposite. Everyone's late to bed. Late to rise. Yeah, right. So yeah, it is. So people eat later here.~

~Like I, I, I, I remember sharing a sunset with, with, with my dinner and everyone made fun of me, and they're like, who eats dinner at six 30? Like fucking everyone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Well, I mean, we have a dinner at six, but yeah, it's it's different here. And it's even more later in Dubai. In fact, actually Dubai is even, I don't know why they, they do that.~

~It's I think it de it depends. I think I, I, in Spain or in Greece? In the Mediterranean, they also do later dinners. And here, here in in India, the, the biggest meal is lunch in in, in Australia, you know, it's breakfast and dinner are big meals. Like, you know, lunch is a smaller meal. It's interesting, it's just.~

~It's different, I think. Mm-hmm. So why is it, why is it only just us this morning? Where is everyone? Hmm. No idea. Maybe, maybe 'cause I momentum might might've I might've gone down a bit, but I was in the uk, which was Mm, which was, which was great for a speaking thing, but also I went to to watch a, a Liverpool game for the first time at Anfield.~

~So that was, that was another dream come true. Tick in the box. Anyway. ~~Hello everyone. Scott, Catherine, Shafi. Nabi. Thank you for keeping me company. I, maybe today I kind of just want to talk about different, models that maybe, you know, we don't know about or haven't been using.~~ ~[00:00:00] anyone ~else?~

~Any, any other ones that y'all are using that, uh,~ you'd like to talk about and you're getting good results with? Yep. I'm, I'm loving notebook, lm dropping everything into there. Like you can drop in 50 sources and then start getting [00:00:10] the notes the suggestions and everything, running the podcast from it.

Then I take the podcast and I feed that in the chat, GPT and I say, tell me all the negatives so that I can [00:00:20] take those negatives and then turn them into positives. So ~it,~ I gave it my website and it said, oh, look, can you believe all this stuff, yada, yada, yada. And he makes these, you know, [00:00:30] promises and things like that.

And I thought, well, if this is whatever you want to call 'em the intelligence pulling it apart like that, then what are real humans thinking. [00:00:40] So I'm taking what the intelligence is saying using their negatives to create positives. ~And then, and, and then what are you doing with that Nabi?~

~Are, are you, are you releasing a podcast in a different way from Notebook lm Once it does, once it does the, the two voices. No. Well, what I've gotta do is go back into the website or whatever I've given them like, it, it might be a book. 'cause I've got a website for each of my books. So it's come out with all the different things and I've got all these different things that I've fed to it~ and everything that's come out with negatives.

I, I go [00:00:50] back in and I change them so that they become positives on a website. So that if I did get~ the,~ the podcasters to go back in it would generate a fully [00:01:00] positive podcast and then send that podcast out to people saying, look, you know, it's not me. Here's a couple of podcasters and what they've done on my site.

~So, who else here is doing, has got a regular podcast on and how often, how regular is your podcast, NABI? I don't have a podcast. Oh, sorry. I un I didn't un I, I, I, I understood that you have a regular podcast. No, no, no. It's the podcast that they're creating from the information that's fed into notebook lm.~

~Right, but you're not that, that that audio is not going anywhere? No. Although I have taken it and sent it to people saying, look, it's not me. Here's some people who are totally independent and what they've thought of, ah, my site, yada, yada. But I'll take the negatives from those and I'll turn them into positives.~

~I see, I see, I see, I see. ~I see. But feeding it into chat, GPT [00:01:10] and saying, ~give me, here's,~ here's the transcription of the podcast. 'cause they generally run between nine to 14 minutes. In the transcription ~take,~ give me all of the negatives and [00:01:20] now let's turn them into positives. Amazing. Okay. Cool. Anyone else is using something different? I'm using gamma. ~Gamma Scott. Yeah, yeah. Just for,~ just for presentations. And I'm also [00:01:30] using something called Mavic, and it's for marketing. ~So it, it really,~ because~ I'm a,~ I'm a nerd. I really haven't had the background with the business marketing sales. And [00:01:40] so I've used ~Maverick,~ Maverick and some~ some ~other stuff in Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi's ~mind ~mastermind group an AI called Gigi.[00:01:50] 

And I've been using it from my branding and from my business persona avatars. How do you spell that? Mavic? It's M-A-V-I-C ai. So there's a lot of [00:02:00] apps now that are embedding. AI in them. So we're probably all using more AI than we know. And that's why it's even more important to have your voice and writing style.

So it's [00:02:10] like, it differentiates. So you're paying for Mavic?

Yeah, I just bought it. Well, I, ~I ~use App Sumo for my Calendly equivalent. It's a one time payment. So I [00:02:20] was on their just 'cause I'm on their mailing list and I saw this medic and I thought, oh, interesting. I'll, ~I'll I'll~ burn a hundred bucks and see if it's got any merit. And it's, so far it's been okay.

Not great, [00:02:30] you know? But Okay. So that's a one-time fee that, ~that ~they were selling through AppSumo. Yeah, I gotta say this Rony, I, I can't help but compliment you every time [00:02:40] we get on these damn calls, but and I, I know you're humble so you can handle it, but that one session that you did with [00:02:50] getting our our voice from our writing where you basically had us, you know, submit five pieces of writing.

I can't tell you how many times I've used that [00:03:00] again and again and again. It's just paying me huge dividends because I'll take all the writing from all these different apps and I'll just run it through that Scott Voice [00:03:10] and it, ~it's,~ people have said, wow, you know, this, this is so you, and it's, no, it's actually part of me, part of it's chat.

GPT. Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate it because [00:03:20] I. ~I, I~ find that you know, for the last two and a half years, people like are using AI without doing it the right way. ~And,~ and actually even worse, people [00:03:30] are selling that to others. And the ones who don't know any better just are sort of buying.

I mean, Mavic is~ is ~a great example in the sense that if you look at their price point [00:03:40] and how things are structured, I mean, ~it's,~ it is a common trend if you look at how software is being released these days. ~Mm-hmm.~ So it's very use case specific. Now, Mavic is a great example. ~It's specific use case ~[00:03:50] for branding.

So I think they're targeting obviously small to medium, you know, businesses especially solopreneurs maybe entrepreneurs who [00:04:00] are dealing with different. We might have a bunch of clients and they want different brands for those clients. And they have you know, $79 a month, forty nine, a [00:04:10] hundred forty $9 a month, $49 a month you know, plus brand workspace.

~So there's,~ there's obviously a recurring income that's coming. ~Yeah. MAV iic.ai. And then,~ and then they go to something like a product [00:04:20] hunt or, you know, abum ~or, or, or those,~ and then it gets the word out to many people. And then there are,~ there are~ obviously people who in general are getting caught [00:04:30] with the whole AI coming up with new things all the time and trying to keep up so they're, -yes.

You know, subscribed to all these newsletters. And as a result, [00:04:40] every time something new comes up, they're like, oh, I've gotta keep ahead. So they. You know what, if this is the best deal right now, and then they go and buy it. And almost always ~there's, there's,~ there's some [00:04:50] great posts inside the school community of people who've used like other apps that have not really been up to par.

But they've seen the advertising come up all the [00:05:00] time and they're going, alright, I might as well just spend $59, $79, a hundred, whatever. ~And ~but if you just understand the basics and the principles around it, you can use that on any [00:05:10] LLM really. And, ~and ~that's what they're doing. ~So that, that's,~ yeah.

I find myself there often I'll look at stuff like this, you know, and social is full of it. [00:05:20] Full of it, literally ~full of it.~ But, you know, I just keep going back to the LLMs and think, well, you know, if you know what you're doing. You can probably get as [00:05:30] good if not much better results if you, ~if you~ do the work of what you're trying to do is, ~is ~educate, ~you know, and I, I,~ you know, I'm old enough, long enough in the tooth that I remember the internet, you know, coming [00:05:40] on board and I, everybody said, oh, I, I don't understand it.

I don't wanna learn it. And it's like, you will, ~it,~ it's gonna become baked into your day-to-day routine. And so [00:05:50] is this, so just, ~you know,~ stop making excuses, ~you know,~ get on board with a mentor somebody like yourself, ronsley and, ~and ~start learning because this is pervasive . [00:06:00] It's, ~it's ~going to be everywhere.

Yeah. I mean, it's already everywhere. I mean, like you just mentioned at the start, you know, everyone's, it's everywhere. Using it in some form or the other. And what's really [00:06:10] interesting is some people are still trying to hide the fact that they're using it. Yeah. ~It's it's, it's, yeah, it's hilarious.~

~So obviously there's this, you know, ~I think~ e you know, when, when social,~ when Facebook first came out, everyone thought that, ~that that's~ what social [00:06:20] was. Facebook was social. So as soon as they got a Facebook account started posting and they understood little bits, and they were like, Hey, I'm a, ~I'm a~ social media expert.

And then they [00:06:30] started to sell their services as a social media expert because they knew how to, you know, post and, ~and ~create stuff on Facebook. Similar stuff is happening right now with AI and everyone that has a chat [00:06:40] GPT account is, ~is ~claiming AI expertise. And don't get me wrong, chat, GPT is like amazing ~as a, as a.~

As an umbrella of an LLM that does a lot of [00:06:50] things and can serve a lot of people and can do all these different use cases. 'cause it's got so many different things that we can do, but it's definitely not the only one. And if [00:07:00] you've attended any of my stuff, you know, that I'm a huge fan of Claude, especially for writing.

It's like night and day, ~um~ In terms of posts and copy and [00:07:10] articles and emails and, ~and ~that kind of stuff. For sure. Also, if you do any sort of coding clause 3.7 sonnet is, [00:07:20] well, it's just, you know, for someone who's gone through so many years of learning how to code, it just feels, so easy.

Right. You know, ~to like,~ to get something up and [00:07:30] running. Because the biggest problem, even for someone that, that's a very, and I'm not a great software developer because there are people who. You know, do this day and day out. ~I, I just~ I know the basics and the [00:07:40] principles and I can code, and I've done stuff, but, ~you know,~ there are still people more competent than me.

And, ~and ~the biggest gap was running into an issue, like, especially if [00:07:50] your code compiled, there were no errors, but it didn't respond the way you wanted it to respond. You're like, oh, I don't even know where to start looking to fix this problem. So now with [00:08:00] ai, that's such a gap that's just, you know, gone.

And if you use cursor and know how to use cursor at all, and you don't have [00:08:10] to actually learn how to use cursor, but ~it is,~ it's ridiculous. Like ~all you need is even,~ you probably just need the basic building blocks ~of, of the,~ of the file structure. Then ~you, you know,~ let cursor [00:08:20] go, go crazy on it and it'll write all your code as well automatically.

And if you watch this in action, it's kind of really, really crazy. Like it's just doing, so [00:08:30] you can say, Hey, ~I want,~ I want to build a to-do list app. And then it'll create the file structure of what a to-do list app will look like, like the backend, the front end and all that stuff. And ~then, then you, and~ you say, okay, [00:08:40] this looks about right.

And then it'll go in and write all the code inside those files, which is absolutely crazy. So you just have to say, ~I, you know, I wanted,~ I wanted to do this, and it'll just write all the [00:08:50] dependencies and everything. So software development has become absolutely crazy. So today I want to just cover some of the things that, you know I've been seeing the different ones that I've been seeing, [00:09:00] obviously Mavic.~ but I can't say I'm a, I'm an authority on call yet. Oh yeah.~ Deeps seek, ~I'll deeps seek~ is good if you just see how ~the,~ the tone has changed around. Deepsea is crazy. Initially it was all, ~all~ the Chinese company and now everyone's sort [00:09:10] of, collaborating ~with,~ with them~ in,~ in a large way.

~I just signed up for, I just signed up for Manness as well. But I haven't Yeah. Really kicked the tires on it yet. Yeah, you'll have to get, wait for an invite. I, I've got the invite I, I'm in and they actually accepted me really quickly. I was surprised, but but I just haven't had the bandwidth to be able to get, get in there and, you know, spend three, four hours trying to figure out the, the, the environment.~

~Amazing. Well, if you, if you are already in and, and you got an, you can get an invite, can you send me one. Yeah. Okay. And I think that if you go on to Discord, you can get in there pretty quick too, but yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll scrape up something for you and maybe I'll leave them post it in the school group too, so people can Yeah.~

~At least be aware. Yeah, that's, that's that's great.~ Nabi ~which one,~ which is the one that you mentioned at the start notebook, lm, ~ah, notebook. Yes, that's right. Notebook.~

~So, but if you, if you didn't know this, these really good ones, ~ I think there are a couple of places I, I'd love you to start to [00:09:20] know where to look for other LLMs gr GRO q.com. For sure. ~I haven't played with that yet. ~ really good, really fast. And, the reason it's fast is because it uses [00:09:30] LPU rather than GPUs.

And and you can use a whole bunch of different, ~different ~models. It's showing you here the difference in speed output and it is really [00:09:40] fast. But here, once you sign up and it's free to just sign in, you could use all of deep seek, you could use Google's, Gemma all of Meta's different [00:09:50] models, menstrual and mixed mixture are really good models that are, ~that are ~uncensored, that are good to use.

And obviously there's new ones from, ~from ~Alibaba, which are Quin. So. Not only is it [00:10:00] free, but you can access a whole bunch of different models that are already in here straight off the bat. And, ~and ~again, it's pretty fast. What is a really good resource [00:10:10] for everyone here is actually most places now have~ have~ these documentation on how to prompt better.

So under Grok Cloud, there's a prompting [00:10:20] guide,~ which I'll put in the chat.~

And perplexity is another good one as well. And to get all that together, you could go do a po. So I, I have po and when you run everything through [00:10:30] PO you'll find gr just blitzes everything. And some are crazy and, ~and you know,~ some are really good. But perplexity is, is a good one as well. ~Yeah.~

~Plexity po. There is I just remembered it. I forgot. How do you spell po? P-O-E-P-O-E-P-O-H. P-O-A-E-E? No, just o O. Yeah. Po like Edward Allen Poe. Edgar Allen Poll. That's the one? Yep. Okay, cool. Poll is ~Copilot

[00:10:40] and ronsley. I just got onto a newsletter. They send out daily. It's called Rundown, and it's a really good. You know, collection of, ~of ~AI [00:10:50] news and tips and tricks, and there's a lot of sort of late and breaking information about stuff like perplexity. Orrock might be the king [00:11:00] today, and three days later it gets eclipsed by Manus or somebody else.

~I mean, it's, you know,~ and everybody ~on this call,~ you know, we're frequent flyers that it's moving fast. Yeah. So not only are we [00:11:10] drinking from a fire hose, but it's ~ It's,~ everything's changing. That's coming outta that damn fire hose. It's amazing. Yeah. So rundowns actually really good. ~I can, I can mention that as to well rundown.~

~Is that a, it's called rundown. It's,~ it's an email distribution list that they send out I've [00:11:20] only been reading it for about a month and it's really good. And the reason they're doing newsletters is because they're getting subscribers and then they get the advertising onto it.

And that's all that it's about. Yes. Yeah, [00:11:30] it's, it's actually a really good, so what I'd love us all to look at, not only y'all, but myself included, is look at how they are doing things. And I think we should model [00:11:40] some of that is including newsletters for our people. You know, because ~every~ actually, everyone wants to be up to date.

They want curated stuff. And with now with AI [00:11:50] Notebook, LM was, is a, ~is a~ huge one. ~You know, you can,~ you can create content, you can create content the way you want it to, and you can do it at speed and you can replicate, and you can do it o [00:12:00] over and over again. You just have to get into the habit of doing it or actually just, you know, pulling the bandaid off and, ~and, and~ putting, ~putting ~it out there.

Because I, tell this story a lot. In fact, yesterday I did a [00:12:10] podcast interview and so on, interviewed me and I said that again. I've been putting out podcasts for like 13 years now. I've easily published 1500 and more episodes in that time. [00:12:20] And last year in August or September, I was having a meeting with Gary and he told me, he was like, you're not putting out enough content.

I'm like, what the fuck? Are you [00:12:30] serious? And, ~and ~every part of me wanted, ~wanted ~to defend myself and say, you know, I put out all this content, but ~I, I want, I,~ I decided to listen and I realized that I wasn't putting on enough content. I was [00:12:40] doing just enough to put out content, but not really tweaking and, ~and, and, and doing,~ doing the reps after publishing.

So it was just publishing and then forgetting, the thing that come after [00:12:50] that. So it was a real good eyeopener for me. And then, he was like, so why don't you use AI to do all the things that you feel like is so hard for [00:13:00] you to do? And I was like, oh, yeah. Like, why don't I like what's stopping me?

So then I started to do that, which has made a huge difference, not only in I. The regularity of [00:13:10] content going out, but also the consistency of content going out. And also things that I used to abdicate before, like we, you know, as a company we've spent [00:13:20] so much of money on getting Facebook ads people in and getting them to deliver leads.

We don't have to anymore. I literally have [00:13:30] stopped all that and done all the stuff myself, and I'm not even joking the leads that I've been able to get over the last, so this is~ this,~ I shouldn't be, but the email [00:13:40] list, but this is just emails over the last month and a bit, or maybe month and maybe month and a few days of people sort of, coming into the system.

And this is [00:13:50] purely me, ~I'm not.~ There's no ad agency, there's no anyone, And so what I'm saying to everyone here is, things have stopped us in the past from putting ourselves out there, and [00:14:00] I feel, using AI to put yourself out there is like the easiest, one of the easiest things to do.

Or ~if you just,~ if we can just stop and, ~and, and~ not get in our own way. So just like, ~just like ~Paul, which is also very [00:14:10] powerful there's a really good one that I highly recommend from abacus.ai called chat, LLM. And it's 10, ~10 ~bucks a month, but ~it, it got,~ it's got access to all the different models in [00:14:20] here.

However, I have to say, both poll and chat LLM or any other LLM or ~any, ~any of these aggregator, LLMs don't give the same [00:14:30] result as if I went straight to Claude or straight to Gemini. Or straight to GPT4. And I think I could be wrong. I think that it's because [00:14:40] of the underlying system instruction. So if you notice most system instruction start with you are a helpful assistant that does X, Y, Z.

So [00:14:50] even that system instruction might be different in, ~in ~all these, that's why they probably are responding differently. So just to keep all these in mind, I mean, chat l lm, but there's one that [00:15:00] I have open here. LM arena.ai is probably the go-to place for what's ranking right now. And~ I, I don't really see, I,~ I don't want you to get caught [00:15:10] up in how quickly things are moving because I.

It's not about how quickly things are moving at all. It's about how quickly can you implement the things that you haven't been able to implement [00:15:20] in your business in the past. ~That's, that's it,~ that's the simplest that I wanted to focus on . the only reason you're aware of all this new things in AI is because [00:15:30] everyone's creating a new, ~new ~newsletter or there's new content going out and you are involved in it.

~This kind of,~ these kind of breakthroughs have been happening in AI for ages. It's just that [00:15:40] no, no one's known about it. It's, it was happening in a silo. So now that everyone's on top of it, it just feels like it's happening so quickly and~ and~ don't get caught up in that. So don't get [00:15:50] caught up in ~the, the,~ the new of open AI with agents that have been released yesterday and the day before yesterday.

Don't get caught up in all that kind of stuff. Don't get caught up in ~witch. ~Which model is, ~is ~[00:16:00] ranking higher. ~But go get caught up in, in, I believe~ I get caught up in this idea, you know, over the last x amount of years that I've been in business, I haven't been able to break through a certain revenue mark, or I haven't been able to [00:16:10] get consistent lead flow, or I haven't been able to deliver in the way that I want.

And, and I haven't been able to get the, ~the the~ case studies or the testimonials the way I want them. So whatever [00:16:20] the block is, whatever ~the,~ everyone has them, it doesn't matter how long you've been in business, everyone has, ~has ~them. So, go after those, go after those thorns in your business [00:16:30] that have not allowed you to push past a certain point.

So whatever that is. So ~if, if, if it is,~ if it is content, which ~most ~it is for most people who care about delivery more than they care about [00:16:40] a truck and convert ~it,~ it usually is, you know, being, out there more. So find whichever one it is that ~that, that~ you can use, that ~that ~gets you those results.

~So L Marina is, is a really good one to look at what, what, what are the different ones out there? But again, you know, you don't have to look at all of them. gotta show you some here that I think are really cool, that are, that are not lms, but lms. Because most ais now are, are LLMs. This is gly glyph app.~

~And it makes some really cool stuff like, memes. And so for example, if you wanted to create say, say a meme. That looked like this. The startup kit meme about AI in business. As an example. Oh, it didn't like me.~

~So I've run some of these before. Like, I also to make a, a meme around ai that's not as good as some of these. Oh yeah. So I may ask it to do a meme about ai where Open AI was complaining that Deep Seek used their models when open AI stole author's data to train their models. So it made this meme, which again, is, is really cool because even though the, some of these words might not necessarily be right, I can, you know, the team can take this meme and put it into Canva or something and edit the words out, but they don't, don't necessarily have to make the meme from scratch, and these are common memes that you can use. For example, this one got, got a lot of, got a lot of engagement on social what, what, what my friends think I do, what my parents think I do, what my boss thinks I do, what society thinks I do, what I, what I think I do, what I actually do. So you can create this all, you know, in your own field, especially if you are a real estate agent.~

~You know, it, it it is like off left field a little bit, but it's still content that gets engagement because people understand irrespective of where you're at, you know, to make these kind of things. So if you had to do this on your own, it would've taken a long time. But if you go into glyph, you can pick your meme and then give it context and it'll come up with some, some really cool things like the AI consultant starter kit.~

~so if someone's an AI consolidate, they totally understand, you know, let me explain how this will 10 x your ROI. It's, it's pretty funny actually. It's, it's pretty good. So, gif gly app is, is, is, is one that I've come across that I've thought is, is pretty cool. You can choose whichever one.~

~You can choose memes and images and stuff like that. Replicate.com is a really nice one. It's, it's, it's, you just have to put a credit card in, but I don't really think that it's much.~

~Yeah, just have a look like I view the total of 78 cents, you know, and I've generated a lot. if you're gonna explore, there's a whole bunch of different models that you can use. And so you can go and create videos, you can create different types of images.~

~You can obviously generate text. There's a whole bunch of different things. Transcribed speech. Actually this is really powerful, the one in replicate.com because I've used some of the image generation in here and I think it's really, it's really great actually. I'm gonna play around. But you can see all the different things that you can do here.~

~You can, create 3D stuff you can use. audio, can remove backgrounds. Obviously background in it's crazy how to remove backgrounds. Used to be, you know, such a thing that you had to pay someone in Photoshop to go and remove backgrounds that is now just a single click in, in Canva.~

~So how that has changed even transcription is another example. I, I use this a lot because we've been making podcasts for people and brands and businesses for maybe 12 or 13 years now. And not long ago we had seven transcribers on our team full-time, and we had 14 content writers who don't exist anymore, which is crazy.~

~So we have zero transcribers. And that that's obviously a, a, a space that is changed quite drastically. So, replicate is great. You can do a whole bunch of different things and replicate. Then spoke about Cursor. Catherine uses Leonardo. Yeah. I, I, Leonardo is good, but I highly recommend Midjourney.~

~My God, the, the, the results I've been able to get in Midjourney~

~are really amazing.~

~Who's used Midjourney here? Anyone? Abbie? Yeah. Have you put out any of the, of your images using Midjourney or where have you used them? I do posts fairly regularly in LinkedIn. I. So, I, I come up with ideas there quite often. I'll do the post in chat GPT and say, give me a graphic that it pulls in from Dali.~

~And if I'm not happy with that, then I'll pull in I'll create one in in Midjourney. And you'll, you are obviously, you got a Pro account and or you are using, is you using the free account? What, what, what are you just a free account? Oh, really? I don't do it that often. Yeah. I don't use it that often.~

~I mean, I don't use that often, but I'm still paying, which makes me think that I should go and check all my subscriptions right now. But as a financial advisor, I would tell you yes, guilty, guilty. But I, I, I feel like mid journey, I've not actually come across a better image generator than, than Midjourney. Just some of the things that it makes like. Wow. I want you to think about how long it would've taken someone to get this picture if they had a mm-hmm. Higher model, you know, get the light writing get the right lighting, you know, then click all the images, then do the edits, and then finally give you this one image, how long that would take.~

~And, and, and, and a lot of these in mid journey, what you can do is you can personalize to your, so you, I've got a certain style, and every time I use the minus, minus p, which is personalized to my style, that's the, that's the command in mid journey that you give to say, generate this image, but generate it in my style.~

~You'll see, see, this is, this is my style. You'll notice that it's a common style. So if I put. this minus minus p it'll create to design, design me an image based on offload busy work. Whenever you think I need to remember this, let ChatGPT handle it. And it created this really, great image.~

~Some of the images that it makes inside my journey are like ridonculous. And if you're not happy, you change it within five seconds. 100%. Yeah. They're really edgy too. And, and some of them are edgy and funny, you know, that's your personality. So they're, they're really good. Yeah, they're really good. and obviously the better you prompt it, the more detailed you given it in the prompt, the better it responds.~

~so I actually made a t-shirt. and I wanted to put a caricature on it. And so I was designing these, caricatures, and then I landed up putting, I think this I think the one with an R on it on my T-shirt. And I thought, I thought that was insane to go for uh, this one to go from, a cartoon or from a concept to a t-shirt with a saying.~

~It's like so quick and it's original, right? Mm-hmm. I don't have to like, worry about, you know, copyright that kind of stuff. So I thought actually what happened was, if you don't know who Gar Seamus is, Gar Seamus is a friend and a leg, and the legend who started ComicCon. So literally he's the guy that started ComicCon, sold ComicCon, then they didn't run it the way he wanted it to run, so he bought it back from them and then grew it into Asia and all these other places, and then sold it again and like, and with, with rules on how he wants it to run.~

~And I met him when I, I I, I've met him a few times, but I, I met him the last time I met him was in Toronto when I was doing my book launch. And we were walking down the street and he was like, Hey, you know what? I would love to be able to get to a point where there's no middleman. It's just me creating comics and that's gonna be my, my, my happy place.~

~So I was helping him come up with, you know, some some. Comic characters, and this was such a fun experiment. Like, look at some of these images are just wow, wow. Just blown away. So we were doing some work then, and, and it was just so cool to like try these things. So Midjourney is really good for that.~

~And and you'll notice if you see this style, you'll notice that this is my personalized style. It, it just keeps re you know, you see the, the orange and the red and the, and and how it, it it represents that. I love how it does exploded views of something. So I've got this prompt that I talk about, you know, provide me an exploded view of a mobile phone.~

~So what does it look, you know, when a mobile phone's exploded out and wow. Like, wow. So yeah, I mean, you know, imagination is literally your only, stopping point. It's, it's just how much you can imagine that, that you can create. So this is mid journey for images, and then I spoke about replicate as well, which I think should be in the image category, but you can do a whole bunch of different things inside that.~

~Now we mentioned poll for LLMs, but then there's, there's chat LLM that you can use for that as well. So two, two of the similar ones. There's, there's Microsoft Copilot perplexity is amazing. I highly recommend Perplexity if you're doing any sort of search, and I feel that, by the way, whoever uses Perplexity will know that the perplexity search is better.~

~Then the open AI search. However, the open ai, deep research is so much in depth that, you know, again, at the start of this session, I was talking about how you should use AI for all the things that were stopping you before. For me, what was stopping me was, or things that I wanted to do that I could not get, right.~

~However much I delegated it. Actually, maybe I didn't delegate properly. I, you know, maybe I abdicated and that's why I didn't get it right. So, I think in entrepreneurship, the more humble you are, the quicker you learn your lessons. So for me, one of the things is, is the long form posts. So I've always wanted to build these long form posts and it's, it's, it was so hard to collate and get it right and put it together, and now it's taking.~

~I would say it takes me a total of 45 minutes to create a long form post like this which would've normally taken, I don't know, days to put together collate. So not only does is it, is it a one-time thing. I've, I've created a four part series and they'll come out, you know, every week. And, and also this long form post, not only like, I can not only send it to, to a whole bunch of people and say, Hey, if you're looking for 25 ways to grow your podcast here are 25 content strategies that you should use.~

~Here are 25 audience engagement strategies that you can use. And I'm, and in the next couple of weeks, you'll get 25 ways to monetize your podcast. And then there's 25 diff different distribution tactics for you to get results. But not only am I sending everyone to this one spot that. They can get all these, really good tips, but also it is creating this pillar post with links to, to my content, which are previous episodes that I've done.~

~So if someone really wants to, for example, this one in particular, building audience engagement as a part one of the growth guide, and it's like, okay, here are 25. Start by actually solving problems. And then if you want more, this is a whole episode that I've done with Ed Dale, that someone can just go and click and, and so it's like not only is it creating a pillow post, it's creating an SEO worthy pillow post that now is getting linked to other content that I've already created before.~

~So for me, this is very useful and very powerful for things that I've been wanting to do for ages that I've just never gotten around to doing it. Or if I've got, if we've gotten to doing it, we've paid someone money and it hasn't gotten done the way we wanted to do, so it never got out. So these are things that I'm implementing that I think that you should really look at and see how you can implement.~

~Because now this post already from the SEO, from the keyword analysis that we got, the analytics that we get from Google is already ranking pretty well, and it's only been maybe a week and a bit that this post has been out. So, ~~use AI for the things that you thought at one time, Hey, I wish I could do that.~

~And, now you can. If you just sort of focus, get it done, make sure you have a process to do it, and then keep repeating it before you get. To do the next process. So don't worry about the new AI tools that are coming out, rather worry about these things that you can implement and execute and then start to get results on.~

~I hope, I'm trying to, I hope I'm making sense about, you know, how, how I, how I I ask, I, I'm asking you to think about using AI~

~ronsley. Can I ask you a question about, about, you're on many platforms and then you're writing. So for example what you just mentioned, do you have a, a ronsley filter persona, voice? For each platform? Or did you set it up, let's say, for example, on chat, GPT and you like it the most there? So you'll take everything raw that you've created, on other platforms like Cloud, and then run it through your voice on chat, GPT.~

~I'm curious about that or do you have it set up on each platform and you're happy with the results? That's a great question. So I don't really think that I'm very happy with the results that come out of chat GPT. I've never really been. Yeah, that was just hypothetical. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, I understand.~

~But however much I have customized my chat, GPT or even the GPTs inside, actually I lie. Platform. So every, every LLM has a backend, like a coding backend that is very dev focused. So for chat gt, it's, it's this platform dot,~

~platform dot what was it? openai.com. And inside here you can if you go in the dashboard,~

~you come down to assistance. You can make assistance in here that are really good. Like I, I, I trust these outputs better than I trust the output coming out of chat GPT. Again, I think it's because of the system instructions that you know, are wrapped around chat g pt that doesn't give you the results that you want.~

~This is, this is way better. So in here I've created assistance that I can call on, which are very powerful. For example, this one is the Amplify AI book. If I, if I throw any instructions at this assistant, it'll take the instructions and return back for you, where in the book I cover. Whatever I'm, I'm asking of it.~

~So if, if, if you're trying to grow operations, then it'll go, oh, Ronsley has covered this in part one or part three of the book. And on this page you can go and find how to grow operations in your business. So it's a, it's an, it's a, it's an assistant that's trained on my book. Then this, here's an assistant that's trained on how I would like my mid journey prompts to be written so I can just throw anything at this and it'll return back a good midjourney prompt for me.~

~And this is all in the backend. So, so rather than me creating GPTs I create these assistants in the background. So I think this is really powerful, which again, I, I totally forgot to mention that. I think I, I, if you're any, if you're technically inclined, then this is a really good place to do that.~

~So, to answer your question Scott, I really like my voice. My voice is very accurate. When it comes out of Claude, I haven't found that in other LLMs. However, if I'm using a lot of data, then I, then I ask Gemini to, collate that because it can take a larger context window. Mm-hmm. And then so for example, that, that, that post that you just saw, which was, you know, the 25 ways to improve your Podcast or Grow your Podcast chat, GPT Deep Research did most of that research.~

~But then the writing part of that, the introduction and the bits in between were done by Claude because that represents my voice better than what Chat GPT could. So, I think there's, there's, there's still an element of human checking involved which might not be too far away from, you know, an agent coming along and you asking the agent to check how you check for your voice.~

~But until that point, I feel like us going through it ourselves and going, okay, this is how we would check it, is probably a good idea so that you can give those rules to an AI in the future.~

~Wow. Thanks for lifting the covers on, you know, how you create that's really helpful for me. I. And I don't want to be greedy, but if I could just throw these out and you could maybe comment on them or defer later. But you didn't mention video, so do you have a favorite video platform these days?~

~And then just a side note, 'cause I'm a bit of a, a, a crypto guy. Your comic example for any creators isn't blockchain the promise of getting rid of the middleman? And again, that can be, you know, we can do that in school in the discussions, but I'm, I just can't help but think in smart contracts, you can get rid of all the middlemen, iTunes for music and, you know, Spotify and, you know, even, even buying a house or brokering a business, you can do it with blockchain.~

~I totally agree. I mean, I find the fact that they're paying bank fees an absolute joke. You know, absolute joke. And when I think about, so for some, for, for us. Our largest bill are bank fees. By, by, by, by a long shot. And I'm talking about everything. 'cause Australia charges, me money when someone pays in USD and then charges me money to convert to to from USD to a UD then it charges me money again.~

~When I pay in USD out, it's a fuck. It's like I cannot stress enough how quickly I want smart contracts to come and take over. Yes, yes. I feel your pain. I'm Canadian, so, and I'm in Mexico, so you know, US dollars always factor in and we get beat, you know, and we convert one to the other. And I have begged businesses to work with, with crypto.~

~It's like, pay me in blood in Bitcoin, pay me in Ethereum. You know, pay me in in anything other than fiat. And some do, some don't. But yeah, it's coming. I, I think see that's, that's the thing with change is that people don't like change and, you know, you know how many middlemen would lose their jobs if smart contracts came around.~

~Yeah. Thanks Chris. Good to see you. So I agree 100%. It's just depends on how, the people in power want it to operate, I suppose. Video you mentioned asked video. Yeah, I, I think trying so is is a good idea, but runway ML is probably the leader in that pack. Okay. Yeah. Great. Alright.~

~Alright, team. Really good to see you all. Thank you so much. It was great. I, I, I love hanging out with you. Thank you for, thank you all for showing up. One more question before you leave Broley. Yeah. Yep. You sent out an email about some new program that you're doing. Yes, yes. Do you wanna talk a little about it?~

~Yes. So rather than doing this, the individual workshops, I wanted to put them all into a 90 day program 'cause, you know, then I could teach one after the other. And it could be, you could get the results straight away. So I'm getting really good, obviously, Shafiq, you've attended a, a couple of the workshops.~

~The results at the back end of the workshops are like amazing. I love all the feedback at the workshop. And then after when everyone's sending me messages going, oh my God, this is mind blowing. So I thought, so the 90 day program is basically creating your whole marketing engine using AI that is from your lead magnets to your nurturing, to your, you know, long post that I've just showed you.~

~So how can in, in nine, in 90 days, we create, you know, hands off your whole AI marketing system to attract new clients into your business. And I'm starting that exactly a month from now, roughly. So April 14th is the week that that starts. And it'll go for 12 weeks. So it'll be basically the courses that you've been doing that, that have been out of this program.~

~Right. Once we've, it'll be the f follow on from those, so it'll be, so if you've done them, it's, it's even better because you've already, you already have the foundation, but it'll No, but there'll be similar in, in the way you're doing them, except it'll be structured. You do step one, then you do step two, you do step three, you do step four.~

~Correct. Is that correct? Correct. Okay. Correct. Correct, correct. And, and, and I, and I'm, and. I don't know if you are in the wait list, but if, if you are in the wait list, then I think yesterday or the day before the team sent out the, the breakdown of what we're gonna cover in each week. They did. They did.~

~Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. I, I wasn't sure. I, I totally understood what it was. And thank you for the clarification and Okay, cool. If the call has not done his classes, they're phenomenal. They're just, thank you. I mean, the, the depth and breadth of what he covers in an hour is amazing. Thank you. Like just your, your, your thing on creating your persona and in using Claude was just spec and I think, Scott, you were on it.~

~Yeah. Yeah, I'm a huge fan. I'm, my biggest thing is, and I think Shafiq, you and, and Nabi and others on the call, you guys are at a, a, a in the evolution of your business. I think that, you know, going back to my coding days, you know, I have to write a program, it's like, well, you know, you haven't even really defined the problem you're trying to solve yet.~

~So for me, I'm so early in developing my business that I don't have SOPs per se. I'm still creating, I'm still I'm building legs on the table, you know, I've got my core business. But I feel like maybe you can talk about this next week ronsley prerequisites. Where do you need to be to really capitalize on this 90 day challenge?~

~And maybe I won't. Jump in this time, but I'll be better set up six months from now or a year from now. 'cause I don't wanna waste anybody's time. I don't wanna hold anybody down, you know, in terms of ballast. But you know, I look at Nabi and I'm always inspired because he's really got something good going on and, you know, obviously been doing, you know, the financial stuff for a long time.~

~He's like, I fooled another one. No, but sincerely, you know, and Ron's the you too. I mean, you got, you're a subject matter expert in this and other things. And so I just want to get a little, maybe you can talk a little bit about the prerequisites if there are any next week. So I, I, I don't think there are prerequisites.~

~I think the on, the only thing that I can think about is have you delivered an outcome to a bunch of people? Like who are your people? And have you delivered the transformation you promised to them? And if you have, that's all you need. Because there are different people in different parts that either have never put out content or have done not done marketing or any of that stuff.~

~The thing that I care about most is, is people who have delivered an outcome and are good at what they do and are not being heard, and are not being found and are the best kept secret. So for them, this is like gold. This is gonna change everything. So if you already got clients and you feel like you don't, you're not, the lead flow is the, the bit that's stopping you.~

~The 90 day program is for you easily. Like, it's just that that's a no brainer. But if you don't have a product and you've not delivered a result and you're just starting off and you, you have a, an idea of what you want to do, then it's not for you. So that's probably the best way to Yeah, to distinguish.~

~Yeah. That's great. I'm trying to cut back on a heck of a lot of stuff. So I cut out all newsletters and everything like that so I can concentrate on my, on my work and stuff. And I saw that come through and I thought, oh no, I'd love to, but I can't devote the time. But how much is it? It's, it's like 1400 or 14 something for the, for the, for the 90 days.~

~Right. And if you are on an early bird, you get like, oh, if you're on a waiting list, there's a discount. And the team has sorted out though. I don't get involved in this, in, in this, in the pricing anymore. It's 1497 and early bird is 500 bucks. Yeah, there you go. 500, sorry. So it's a thousand. Yeah. Nine 97,000.~

~That's really reasonable. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, the idea is it's economical and not, not only economical, it's, it's about getting the result. And I know that in 90 days that you'll get the result and you'll be like, oh, the lead's coming in. There's, there's, you know, money coming in. And that's, that's what I care about.~

~I don't really, you know, and I just want people serious enough to implement. So, yeah. Feel no pressure either way. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just here to serve really. And they're recorded. If we're able to attend live, right? It's all recorded. They'll, each one will have a playbook. Each one will have a playbook and a checklist and how to execute and process and prompt list and prompt packs and, and everything.~

~Just like how we had the playbook for the previous ones, Shafiq that are easy to follow and yeah. Yeah. Alright, team, I've gotta jump off. Greater hangout with everyone. Yeah. Thank you for, for showing up. I'll see you next week. Cheers. Bye guys.~
