Ronsley Vaz: ~No.~

~Hmm. Testing. ~

~Testing.~

~All right,~

~All right. ~

~we are recording ~

~We are recording~

~Presu Asian. ~

~Presu Asian. ~

~So there's this brilliant idea in that, I'll start again. ~

~that. I'll start there's this brilliant idea that good marketing makes sales easy. ~

~makes sales ~

~is the idea of Presion. I mean, I wrote that down on a card. I'll talk to you all about it. And in presion or Presion, we meet our audiences where they're at and we create assets for them that compound over time.~

~Today I'm gonna show you how to do that at speed. So if you were in a similar position as me and wanted to create like useful videos for your audiences, that was termed as good marketing, I'll ask you to give you. I'll ask you to give me 15 minutes of your time, and in that time I will show you how to use AI at speed, but also to create authentic, really good marketing that is useful for your audience, but also gets them closer to yes, whatever that looks like for you.~

~Your, the idea in this session is I'm gonna show you everything that I've done and I'm gonna show you how to get it done yourself. Come, let's learn. ~

~Come, let's learn.~

~All right. ~

~It's the start. Obviously. Just cut that out a little bit when I mean, you guys know what you're doing.~

~I mean, you guys know what you do. ~

~what you're doing. ~

~Okay, so backstory ~

~backstory~

~backstory.~ [00:00:00] A month ago I was in Mexico at an event. Great event. And in that event I took down this 

I took down this. 

piece of note, [00:00:10] which is Rethink your Content Recording Strategy. And on the back of that I made a little note which read. [00:00:20] Presion Marketing makes sales easy, and it's this idea that I got from this event in Los Cabo and because I wrote it down [00:00:30] like I have other 

~I get to action them or~ I put them on the back burner.

And because this was a very important action. Here it is, and today I'm gonna show you how to go from idea to [00:00:40] context to make useful pre to Asian marketing. This is kind of on the intersection of creating assets, which I learned from Daniel Priestly. Huge shout out to him. [00:00:50] Create assets for your business that compound over time.

So it is bringing assets together with dog fooding. It's another great concept if you haven't. If you don't know what that [00:01:00] is, I, I suggest searching it. It's the idea of eating your own dog food. So this, these next actually, uh, I'm going on this really interesting [00:01:10] journey and this is the first of many episodes where uh, I bring together AI and podcasting.

I bring together creation of assets and dog fooding. [00:01:20] And you know what? I've heard this a lot and I think today is, now is a really good time Uh, AI is made up fields and everyone's trivializing it. People are just learning themselves. They're just [00:01:30] saying things in good marketing and everyone's believing it because they see a video.

But I kind of want show you something. Just gimme a sec. 

you something. ~Just gimme a second. ~

~This, this is the Bible, by the way. This is the Bible of artificial~ intelligence, everything, all the basics [00:01:40] here. And I want, I, I just wanna tell um, come together to create artificial intelligence? All right, the first one,

All right, 

the first one, [00:01:50] 

pH.

Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions? How does the mind arise from a physical brain? Where does knowledge come from? All this is part of philosophy doesn't field number one. Number two, [00:02:00] field number two is mathematics. What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions? What can be computed?

Computed? How do we reason with uncertain information? [00:02:10] Number three, economics. How should we make decisions in accordance with our preferences? How should we do this when others may not go along the next field after [00:02:20] economics is neuroscience. How do brain process information?

Camera B: brains process information? 

Ronsley Vaz: psychology. How do humans and animals think and act? So [00:02:30] in that, there's cognitive psychology. There's a whole bunch of different ones. Number six is. Computer engineering, how can we build an efficient computer? Number seven [00:02:40] is control theory and cybernetics. How can artifacts operate under their own control?

And number eight is linguistics. How does language relate [00:02:50] to thought? Now I'm just, I'm literally just, you know, brushing the surface just explaining what Different, very valid fields that have come together to [00:03:00] create artificial intelligence. And it is kind of being trivialized on top of the computer engineering field is each, there's memory and long term memory and short term memory.

There's so many aspects that come together. [00:03:10] And today's session, I'm gonna show you how to ideate, how to create, how do you start your journey if you're like me, on how to make videos or create [00:03:20] topics, or actually just create assets in general. Alright, so let's start with. The idea of persuasion and the Amplify AI persuasion [00:03:30] framework.

persuasion framework. Asian framework. Now, this is really important to understand as the basis for all the episodes going forward. [00:03:40] When you think about your audience, right, they are in a couple of places, but they are either audience. or active in their buying intent.

And you can, [00:03:50] and we've represented that by the X axis here. So the either latent. Or they're active. And the Y axis is they're either low on trust and proof that you can deliver, [00:04:00] or they're high on the trust and proof that that, that you the, in terms of marketing, that's all you have to worry about in terms of presion.

You just [00:04:10] have to worry about these four elements. The, or intent. And the trust and proof. And now you might think that this is not an important [00:04:20] po piece in the puzzle, and you only have to focus on orchestrating the yes. And it's not true. Each one of these sections here are very important and you gotta [00:04:30] create assets that get them to this point of where they say yes to buying.

Okay, let's start with. If they are [00:04:40] low on trust and proof, they don't know who you are, they don't know what you, what, what you can deliver. They're very new audience to you and they're kind of latent in their buying. You know, they're not, they're not [00:04:50] ready yet. So in that, in that instance, they and patent.

They, your, your job is to earn attention via rep reciprocity. You want to [00:05:00] earn attention via reciprocity, and in this space you want to create. A bunch of different assets. Something that delivers quick wins, something that's less than three [00:05:10] minutes. A video that actually delivers some value in way they think, in the way they act, in how they're gonna do things going forward.

Okay? Uh, return on [00:05:20] something. Really important. Swipe a pool checklist. So in your, in this of assets, and I'm gonna show you. Over the next few episodes and in the episodes coming up, [00:05:30] how to do these at speed 

Camera B: to do these at 

Ronsley Vaz: using make them true to you.

Just like how today's episode is and how, you know, what you're seeing [00:05:40] right now is created using ai. But it's all built on a lot of knowledge and, and, and work as a company. Okay. [00:05:50] And in KPIs. Like, what are the opt-in rates? What's the time on page?

What are the new accounts that start following? So this is like really important KPIs to keep track of. [00:06:00] And if I were you, I would start thinking about AI team members that augment 

Camera B: that augments 

Ronsley Vaz: what your human team members do to, to [00:06:10] allow them to So this, these are.

AI team that could help you in this prime and pattern stage, which are like uh, signal listeners. They're listening [00:06:20] signals in the you of things that you don't have to go out and search for. You can create personalized leads, magnets, and to create strategy and pillar content [00:06:30] like we're doing today.

So that's all in the prime section. Okay, so. If we move along and they are, you know, have, have active [00:06:40] buying intent, of low on the trust cycle. Now these people are ready to buy. However, they, 

Camera B: however, 

Ronsley Vaz: um, whether you can actually deliver on what you're [00:06:50] saying you can.

Okay. And if that's the case, then you want to. You wanna borrow state, and neutralize risk with the proof, with proof that can that's our [00:07:00] goal in this section. So to create assets there, we want to create like a a a 92nd clip. We wanna show outcome [00:07:10] snapshots.

We want to create content that is before and after dashboards that have worked. We want to have uh, 

Camera B: We want to have, 

Ronsley Vaz: real words and case [00:07:20] studies and people saying good things about us. And that's kind of borrowed, borrowed authority in this area, looking 

Camera B: this area you're looking for, 

Ronsley Vaz: know, back to you, how much are they consuming [00:07:30] and how many of them are asking for demos or does this work?

I want to help can you help? Can you help me AI team members that can help your. Human team members do their That's [00:07:40] a case study assembler. You know, an AI can totally, you know, do that. An auto nurturer, which is an AI that will nurture a lead automatically and personalize it, [00:07:50] a retargeting ai.

So really interesting ways of now doing 

Camera B: ways of 

Ronsley Vaz: marketing or using AI that [00:08:00] potentially you are missing out on because maybe you haven't thought about it like myself, but. And we've got some of these in play. I'm gonna show you over the next obviously few episodes how we build them as [00:08:10] well. So again, now for, for people the trust value, for example, now they know that you can deliver.

They, they, they know [00:08:20] that you are, 

Camera B: know that you 

Ronsley Vaz: they're not ready to buy yet. They're in the, in that latent buying intent space. So basically what you want is just to keep, make sure that you are continuing to [00:08:30] add value. Uh, This video potentially could be uh, one of those where I'm just adding value.

But, you know, it is no, there's no [00:08:40] to buy. It's, Hey, have you thought of these things in your business? And what you're doing here, you're trying to make sure that they, they, these assets compound over time and [00:08:50] they keep. You top of mind right in here.

You have like serial mini lessons. You can invite, I could invite people to office hours. I can give them [00:09:00] ROI calculators that we've built for our clients and maybe have um, acquired a, to our clients license and we could just give them that. So they already [00:09:10] are know, but you know, that we can deliver.

But you know, they, they're not ready to buy yet. And that's totally cool. In that space, you should have an an AI team member that. [00:09:20] Distilled topics an idea and it'll give you a topic an AI team and distribute it through your pipeline of different places that you are active or your audience is [00:09:30] active and they know that you can deliver or they, they're paying attention to you on those platforms.

And finally, this is what everyone sort of does. And [00:09:40] sometimes if the. If your person in this area, but you give them this kind of asset to orchestrate the yes, then it's a big jump for them. And you [00:09:50] feel like they feel like you're being salesy though you're not. And we want to avoid that, right? So when people are in this area and they have high proof, they know that you can deliver [00:10:00] and their buying intent is there.

You want. 

Camera B: there. 

Ronsley Vaz: To orchestrate the yes, you want to make sure that acting now is just the [00:10:10] obvious step. And if that's the case, you have to create some assets, like, you know, what is the fast start bonus that you can offer them? What are the implementation windows that exist [00:10:20] that allow you as a company to deliver the best result for your people?

Like for example, we only take, you know, a certain amount of clients in every month and we are very [00:10:30] clear that we can't take. A client on at any time, at every time, because we've gotta get ready as a team to take on the workload. We've gotta make sure that we've onboarded [00:10:40] the client correctly. And also you cohorts and in these limited cohort invites and these assets that you're making, which by the way, I'm gonna show you exactly how to do it.

I want to [00:10:50] show you how we are gonna do ours. So you can do yours, just like how I'm gonna show you uh, in, a little bit how I built this framework using ai [00:11:00] um, which is come up, right? Um, In this section KPIs to track, which is conversion rates, you know, time to close and deal velocity in the sense that how [00:11:10] much leads are coming in and how those deals are being processed.

Camera B: Processed, 

Ronsley Vaz: about that's really gonna help is like a triage [00:11:20] AI team member for sure. One that qualifies and routes them into a certain area, a personalized offer, AI that can deliver an offer [00:11:30] based on a sales call. And like daily rollups that, you know, if you're getting a lot of traffic coming in, an AI team member that makes sure that it.

Takes all [00:11:40] that data and summarizes it and gives it to the right person in the right time, in the right order. So this is a, you know, like going forward, I'm gonna show you how to create all these [00:11:50] different assets, you know, for all these different sections of your audience. Today is obviously an overview of this uh, framework, but I'm gonna show you my [00:12:00] screen in a second 

Camera B: how. 

Ronsley Vaz: And actually it's really, really useful. 

Camera B: Useful. 

Ronsley Vaz: So started. Very simply, I, note that that note, [00:12:10] which I thought was uh, the idea. So for me to. To, for, for the some research. So I went into perplexity. And Perplexity a, a, a really [00:12:20] cool tool.

happen to have a pro account, but you can use this even on the, free account allows you to do a bunch of different, [00:12:30] three different pro users a day. So you can use one of them for this. So. Literally I video about Presu agent and how marketing makes sales easy.

Amplify [00:12:40] ais.com is our website. We build a i team members for businesses, a million in revenue and above. There will be a way to strategize, ideate, create, repurpose, publish, market this, [00:12:50] consider it a type of dog fooding see what works right now and what is key for my audience. So I wanted to kind of go out and do some research and come back and then what [00:13:00] it did strategy.

Presu agent for, for Amplify AI is the core concept issu agent. As a sales accelerator, your video should position Presu agent as a bridge between marketing [00:13:10] and effortless sales. And it kind of had of the three, three psychological triggers to highlight is reciprocity, social proof, and authority, and scarcity and [00:13:20] urgency.

Um. So what go too far down this, I didn't like, I read the whole thing, which was structure core content, a framework. But [00:13:30] you know, I, I saw this, the Presion framework and I said, oh, that is a great idea, idea in terms of this is a really good way to [00:13:40] anchor. This video to the rest of the videos that I'm gonna create because I wanted to create persuasion and I want to create a stop.

So I wanted to create a [00:13:50] persuasion framework. Now I took that and I into

We have don't know who. Uh, if you don't [00:14:00] know who Edith is Edith is our ai uh, that is an amplify AI and ethics driven uh, [00:14:10] intelligence. triage helper. That's the full form of Edith. inside the way, in, in, in one of the upcoming, the next we built Edith so you can [00:14:20] build. And need it for your business. But I took that and I said either I need help to create a persuasion framework for marketing using a i. [00:14:30] So you notice that I've not even spelled that correctly. to explain this or another framework that you think is better.

Here's some context. And I literally copied and pasted the first [00:14:40] section,

gave out, right? Until the right position, central question. So I said design the Presu agent framework. Now it [00:14:50] thought for a while, 28 seconds to be exact, and it came up with this, here's a clean found, a friendly way to make persuasion, which is the two by [00:15:00] two power grid.

Now I'll, you know, just uh, another framework, which is the presion flywheel. It's an operating loop where you listen, learn, and we've [00:15:10] built these ais we've named.

Just like how we have Edith, we have radar that listens and tracks intense signals. We have scout that learns and enriches the [00:15:20] account and kind of adds to. A knowledge base. So we have all these different ones. That's what you're seeing here in, in um, that is from base, but it's, it's [00:15:30] kind of gone and another really cool um, a also done this great job of doing, you know, the, the, the message what to [00:15:40] say, triggers and all this kind of stuff. Yeah, but while it gave me this, I thought what was really important for me is to understand what it [00:15:50] put out. So then I took this AI appreciation power grid, which was exactly what I was after, which I just presented to you earlier.

Right? And it [00:16:00] really broke it down. Now, I didn't write everything down because, for example. Um, You wouldn't was until I kind of mentioned these right now. So it's pulling this [00:16:10] from E'S knowledge base. Um, really great breakdown of a framework, was very valuable and that's really how I created that [00:16:20] today.

Which sometimes when you look at something like that, you would think that, and there used to be a time where I would have to like think for a long time to [00:16:30] come up with each one of these sections. Now, not only has it given me this amazing framework, but it's told me. All these really important [00:16:40] assets that I need to create, which we have some of them, but we don't have them in a really proper way that we can make u useful.

So it's these [00:16:50] areas, which is the dog fooding piece of us creating, or me creating this for our business as part of our recording process. [00:17:00] So join me in the upcoming videos. I'm gonna show you how we're gonna create a bunch of assets. In the next one, I'll we created Edith, how we created a, a structure and a [00:17:10] framework to create these videos.

And if you want anything that I've just shared, you know, put it in the comments or wherever you found this. So, um, one of the team will find what you're [00:17:20] after. Uh, I would love to be able These things are really important because commoditizing AI and it's used. In the right way and not [00:17:30] people just making up new words and just for marketing and making everyone think that, that that's the way to do it.

So I want to [00:17:40] remove the hassle of bad information 

Camera B: of bad 

Ronsley Vaz: and, and hopefully give you something that, that you can use now. 

Camera B: that's 

Ronsley Vaz: 24 [00:17:50] minutes. 

Camera B: Thanks team.
