131. Prompting Framework with Vayner Media
===

Ronsley Vaz: ~I want to quickly go into a prompting framework because I think this is very valuable for everyone that is kind of going to use AI and do it quickly.~

~So I've got a,~ [00:00:00] I've got a prompting framework, the seven steps, and the seven steps is basically the idea of how you can delegate like an entrepreneur. Now, the biggest [00:00:10] jump that any business owner goes is from a solopreneur to an entrepreneur, ~because with. ~Going from a solopreneur to an entrepreneur, you have team and with team comes recruitment and operations and culture and [00:00:20] process and all these other elements that come as part of it.

But what happens is ~we can't, we,~ in that jump going from solopreneur to entrepreneur, we learn to delegate, [00:00:30] but sometimes we, and most times we don't delegate properly because ~we can't,~ we have the value alignment problem. We can't fully express exactly what we want a person to do [00:00:40] because. It's in our head and we think that they should have all this information that we already have.

So, use this framework to delegate. And [00:00:50] this framework you can use to delegate to AI. Like, you could use this to delegate to another human being. Alright? So, there are the seven steps that you [00:01:00] want the AI to know in your prompt. Okay? The first thing you want it to know is the result. What's the goal? That you're trying to achieve.[00:01:10] 

Okay. The 2nd is what is the essential pieces of information. Now, if you were giving that task to a person, what information does that [00:01:20] person need to execute on the prompt and do they know how to complete the task? All right, so that's the essential piece of information ~and, and I'm, I'm putting this in order of like importance.~

~Okay,~ so the first [00:01:30] thing you need is the goal. The second is the essential information that you need to complete the goal. And the third is what is the final representation of the output look like? [00:01:40] What does that supposed to look like? So if you only have those three, your prompt is going to be better than most prompts out there.

Now, if you add the next four [00:01:50] elements, it's going to be even better. If you, ~if, if,~ if you want an AI to act as a person, ~what would that,~ what would that entity be? If you say write an email, you'd want ~the, the,~ [00:02:00] the entity to be. ~Your ~your assistant as an example, if you were writing a marketing plan, you want the entity to be a marketing manager So give it more [00:02:10] context and it will improve the prompt so character The next thing is approach.

So if you already know what? ~ ~Approach or what process you want [00:02:20] AI to take, then say that I want you to do this first and then do this next and then do that afterwards. That will improve your prompt even further. Then you [00:02:30] say, well, now that you have all these essential pieces of information, I think you can make it even more relevant because this is the kind of person I'm talking to.

And ~this is the kind of,~ this is what they care about. So then you're [00:02:40] refining and you're giving it even more context. And then finally you're saying, well, the output is for this person. So if you have all these seven elements in your prompt, you will [00:02:50] get exactly what you want out of AI. So if you prompt AI in this manner.

You will get exactly what you're after from AI. [00:03:00] I'll give you an example. ~All right. This is,~ this is what I'm after is a template for, you know, podcast guests that are coming onto my podcast. So ~I'll,~ I'll read this out. Act like my personal [00:03:10] assistant. And write me a template email for my podcast guests informing them about the episode going live.

The essential pieces of information is this is the episode number, this is [00:03:20] the date it gets released, these are the topics it covered, and here's where you can find the assets. Okay, that's essential. The approach I want you to take is, I want you to [00:03:30] first highlight their genius, Thank them, mention something unique about the episode, and then ask them to share it.

In the tailoring, I want you to be memorable [00:03:40] when you're creating this template, and I want the template to create conversation. The output should be in Ronsley's voice style, and the recipient is a podcast [00:03:50] guest that has appeared on the show. So you see how, instead of me just saying, write me an email template, this has get so much more context and it will give me [00:04:00] exactly what I want.

And it won't even take a minute to fill out if you were doing this, but once you get used to it, you can just write the prompt on the go. ~You get, you get,~ you get good at [00:04:10] it. ~So that is, that is how you write a prompt. I wonder whether there's any questions on that that maybe I can answer. ~

Andrea Sullivan: ~Ronzi, I have a question.~

~Just do you, ~I know there are so many different platforms. When you went about that particular task, do you, have you been using chat GPT or cloud. [00:04:20] ai, or do you have any preferences or any suggestions on different platforms to use for what kinds of tasks? 

Ronsley Vaz: So, so far, so what's going to happen is [00:04:30] different models are going to evolve differently.

What's happening right now is everyone's using chat [00:04:40] GPT. So what is happening is any output from most outputs from chat GPT are being labeled as AI output. And everyone can read it [00:04:50] and go, Oh, that's AI, but it's actually chat GPT output. So even if you use Claude for writing marketing material, people won't even know the difference because it's [00:05:00] like such a different way of writing because it's a different model.

So I find Claude and Gemini really useful for writing marketing material. [00:05:10] Let me show you an example. ~So can you see my screen? ~

James Orsini: ~Yep. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Yeah. Okay. ~So this is Claude. All right. Now inside Claude, I have different projects, but I have this Amplify AI version two project [00:05:20] in here. In here, I have put who my audience is, my custom instructions, rules for writing LinkedIn posts.[00:05:30] 

And some examples of posts that I've worked before. Okay, let me show you how long it took me to write show notes yesterday. [00:05:40] So I literally took the transcript of the edited show notes. Oh, sorry, of the [00:05:50] edited podcast. And I put that in and I said, take the time to read this transcript. Because I have trained it and it knows exactly how to write in my [00:06:00] voice.

It took that, wrote the title. And then wrote the description in my voice Hey, Hey, AI Geeks, it's Ron Slee. ~Ever written,~ [00:06:10] ever written what you thought was a decent prompt only to get useless response? Today, I'm sharing how one simple line turns mediocre prompts into gold. And the best part, you [00:06:20] probably already know the information AI needs.

You're just not telling it properly. So ~it's actually,~ it's actually written that in my voice and better than I could have said it myself. And then wrote. The whole [00:06:30] description, and this took less than 30 seconds. So these posts are quite easy to write. Now I'll show you [00:06:40] another one that I wrote. 

James Orsini: One thing on one of your webinars, I, I seem to remember you, you saying that obviously there, there's, we, we keep talking about chat [00:06:50] and, and Claude, but there is a plethora of AI that specializes in, Hey, if you wanna LinkedIn bio, use this ai. You know, [00:07:00] if you're looking to revise an old article to sound new, use this AI.

Yeah, 

Ronsley Vaz: so that is, so once you go to chat GPT, [00:07:10] that's what I'm talking, what James is talking about is if you go to chat GPT on the left hand side here there is explore GPTs down the [00:07:20] bottom. And if you click on that, you get a whole bunch of different, very specific GPTs that. AIs that do very [00:07:30] specific functions.

For example this one that sort of is an AI humanizer. Now, you know, it's a good one because, you know, it's a decent one, at least, because there's [00:07:40] so many conversations and there's over, it's over four stars and there's over, you know, a thousand ratings and it's number two in, in, in writing. So you can [00:07:50] see how people are using it you know, for copy.

This one is for productivity. There's different ones that these are really, this was really useful for me when I was writing my [00:08:00] book to find different things that work, like consensus does research papers. So it goes and does all the literature review research papers that gives [00:08:10] you a bunch of research papers instead of you going to the library and finding them.

Video summarizer, you just put in the YouTube link and it'll summarize the video for you. So there's all these different ones that [00:08:20] in here, if you can just type LinkedIn. ~ ~And then it'll find you profile riders. So there's different tools that can be used already that are in here. This is what [00:08:30] James was talking about.

~Yeah, it's, it's, it's like, ~it's like the biggest problem right now is there's so many tools you don't even know what to use. That's why you've got to go the other way. ~What, what, where does,~ where do you need help? And then look for the [00:08:40] tool for that rather than find the tool and see if it fits into your process.

I'm just going to yeah, please go 

Diana Gleason: ask you a [00:08:50] quick question. So, something that is like, top of mind for my team, we're all remote and I'm updating my website and, you know, not everybody has the headshot they like [00:09:00] and then. They're like, can't AI make me a headshot? And I'm like, I, I think, but I don't know.

I'll ask Ronsley. , . 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah. There are a few. [00:09:10] I think flux.ai is probably one flux That does. Okay. Yeah. But ~I will,~ I will get you some names.~ I. I'm sure there are, you know, ~there are ones that keep improving, and I know that our video team [00:09:20] uses some of them, so I'm just going to ask them which ones they use.

Okay. Yeah,~ and I'll, and I'll,~ and I'll yeah, I'll get back to you. 

James Orsini: Thank 

Ronsley Vaz: you. ~But yes, you can totally, ~

Jeff Schuppe: ~yeah. I have another quick question. Oh, yes, please. Sorry, Avery. ~What about secured [00:09:30] information? I know, you know, if you're just out there on chat GPT without a pro, it just goes out into the wild. But if you do [00:09:40] pro you might be behind the firewall.

If you're trying to look for all these different ones, you know, just like Netflix and Hulu and Paramount plus all of a sudden you've [00:09:50] got 80. Subscriptions that you don't know what to do with and how to manage. How do you worry about secured? You know look into ai 

Ronsley Vaz: [00:10:00] so what's the information that you're trying to secure jeff? 

Jeff Schuppe: Well, I mean i'm not too worried about marketing type stuff for my personal brand and things like that but if I do get into [00:10:10] business intelligence, in other words~ if I ~If I want to take anything proprietary to my company, you know, financials or our secret sauce or anything like that, but I want to [00:10:20] write it into a presentation and not have it be out ~into the,~ into the world.

How do I do that? 

Ronsley Vaz: So it's super hard. So [00:10:30] there's a big difference between information and intelligence and. It's extremely hard if you use in whatever way inside [00:10:40] chat GPT, for example, you say, this is our secret source. Can you help me do X, Y, Z. It is super difficult for [00:10:50] anyone, including chat GPT to go back and find that information unless.

You keep using that to train the model. [00:11:00] Now, what I mean by that is there are, there are some of them that are already out in the, in the universe. For example, my method is already in the book, right? So it's already [00:11:10] kind of published. The different methods, frameworks that are already exist, like the SWOT analysis.

Everyone knows how. to implement a SWOT analysis. But your method is [00:11:20] so unique to you that someone has to recall that so many times for that to actually become a thing.~ And I don't think that that's going to be ~I don't think anyone can retrieve that information easily is the [00:11:30] first thing I'm going to say unless it is client information.

Now, what I, what, what you don't want to do is say Ronsley Vars. That lives here with [00:11:40] this mobile number and this email address, so that data you want to avoid putting into touch it because then that is. [00:11:50] Personal information of people that you don't want to put in there, but your stuff in terms of this is how we do things [00:12:00] is super difficult to retrieve.

Okay. But if you really want to be specific that you would use the API. And so the [00:12:10] API for ChatGPT or any of the AIs do not train the model so that whatever you're using, that information ~is not gone,~ doesn't [00:12:20] go to train the model. Okay, so you're going to use it separately from the actual interface for you to actually do that the way you want to do it.

Avery Patrick: I have a [00:12:30] question if, if that answers your question, Jeff. Hi, Ronsley. If we miss this. But, I was wondering, my chat GPT upgraded to the like [00:12:40] 200 subscription, do you think I could possibly be doing anything that actually needs that? Oh, yeah. I mean, Sora is like super valuable if you can start [00:12:50] to create some some videos.

Ronsley Vaz: Let me just share screen again. But what if we're not doing video? Oh yeah. I mean, [00:13:00] there's a lot that depends on how much you, you're actually using it right now. Are you, how much are you using it every? I use it all the time. I talk to it at night before [00:13:10] bed.

James Orsini: It's cheaper than a husband. I sit in the cat 

Vayner Media Member - 8: with it at night. She has a very nice husband. I do. 

Ronsley Vaz: ~I think, I think it's very,~ I think 200 ~is,~ is for me, is like a no brainer, ~even though I I think, but do you find~ if you're [00:13:20] using it all the time, it's 200 is nothing. Right. So I don't think. Okay. But I do think that you should play with Sora~ and it, like, they're creating some crazy images.~

~Like,~ just imagine these videos would have to, how [00:13:30] much you have to do to actually get them filmed. Yeah. Like, you know, two months ago, this was not even possible. ~One second. ~

Diana Gleason: ~Sorry. Okay. Thank you. ~How do you [00:13:40] make these? Like, ~what do you tell it to make you?~ You can tell it to make you a video. 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah. 

Diana Gleason: Like, I'm just a dope.

I'm sorry. Like this. 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah. Yeah. So 

Diana Gleason: that looks really cool. [00:13:50] Yeah. 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah. Sorry. Dot com. And you can even go through them and see what prompts have been used. So, so if you go here and you click on that, it'll say, okay, [00:14:00] here is the prompt. That's used. 

Astha Avinash: Okay. 

Ronsley Vaz: So then you can just take this prompt and then edit it to how you want it to look [00:14:10] cool.

Yeah. And then there's some, there's some ridiculously cool ones in here. 

Will: I always wonder what happens if you put in a prompt that is completely [00:14:20] unrealistic.

Give me an example. Can you make a video that makes accounting cool. ~So that's so generic and, and. Well, I mean, that's not like, it's like, you know, I talked to Diana about it. Like, it's how do you make content that makes accounting cool? So ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~you can,~ if you define what cool is, it'll do that. So define what you mean by cool and say, [00:14:30] this is what I mean by cool.

Like for me, yeah, 

Diana Gleason: like, so Will, like I would do something like make accounting look sexy and appealing to [00:14:40] women creatives. Right. 

Ronsley Vaz: Like, get real 

Diana Gleason: specific like that. 

Ronsley Vaz: Even more specific. What does sexy and appealing mean? What is appealing [00:14:50] to women? ~What is,~ what is sexy? What is sexy? Okay. Make 

Diana Gleason: accounting, right?

Make a woman feel empowered as fuck, right? Like, something. 

Ronsley Vaz: What, what does the empowered [00:15:00] look like? The women would feel like they have control over their finances. Like what does that look like? 

Diana Gleason: Right. 

Ronsley Vaz: Even describe 

Diana Gleason: that even further. Yes. Okay. Okay. 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah, [00:15:10] more context better context is everything. I've got a few more slides that I want to cover if that's cool.

Vayner Media Member - 8: Go ahead. Am I on? You're on. [00:15:20] Oh. My mom has a question. Ronsley? 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah. Hey. 

Vayner Media Member - 8: Hi. How are you? 

Ronsley Vaz: Amazing. How are you? 

Vayner Media Member - 8: Good. I,~ sorry, we were late. I, so again, it's a dumb question, I think, but ~if I put stuff in there that [00:15:30] is like, ~like, ~proprietary, does it get stolen? 

Ronsley Vaz: No, ~I was just saying that to Jeff, like it's super hard for some,~ it's like, it's not search So it's not like once it's there, someone can search for it and [00:15:40] find it.

It's a neural network. It's not, this information is stored here that I can easily retrieve it. That's not what happens. [00:15:50] 

Vayner Media Member - 8: Okay, thank you.~ I'm sorry I missed that before. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~No, that's all. That's okay. That's good. Let me just share this because I want to show you a ~

James Orsini: ~question on that. It doesn't get stolen. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Hi.~

~Hi. ~But does it get used for training data? Or as training data? So, in general, the [00:16:00] rule that I have is if it is Okay. proprietary, and you're worried about sharing it, don't share it. ~Like that is just standard. ~The other way to do it is~ which screen can you see my slide deck? Is that the screen you can see this?~

~Yeah. If I did~

~so so if I open terminal, I went,~

~ so this now~ [00:16:10] 2 

but it's just text based at this point. I can have a UI, but, and again, but it's not, again, as powerful as some of the, [00:16:20] some of the models that are out there.

So I would use an internal model like this if you're worried about proprietary stuff. That doesn't go [00:16:30] anywhere, then this stays on your computer in here and doesn't go anywhere. And by the way, this you can use on a plane without internet as well. So [00:16:40] this is intelligence on your laptop that you don't need any chat GPT account or cloud account or any, you don't have to pay for anything on this.

[00:16:50] Right. And you can still say, write me an article on Penguins, and it'll still [00:17:00] do what a chat GPD would do, but on your laptop. Okay. Well, that's right.

[00:17:10] What I'd love to show you is Gary's book, day trading attention has got this. Flow chart, it is how you create [00:17:20] cohorts and then strategic organic content, depending on your platforms and pack and and how you amplify that ~and ~and how you, you make it better. So, [00:17:30] based on that if you use IMX, who helps why achieve Zed ~in, in, in, in your, in the slides, there's this training notes.~

~If you go, I don't know whether I have enough time. Julia, do I have enough time to go? Was it a hard stop in three minutes? ~

Astha Avinash: ~Hard stop. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~Okay. Sorry. So, that's cool. In,~ in your slide deck that you have access, you'll see training notes. If you click on training [00:17:40] notes, you'll open a link that will show you the exact method that I did for the first crew on the video and how to use [00:17:50] the cohorts.

So, you start with IMX who helps Y achieve Zed, and then you run this first prompt. And it'll give you it'll give [00:18:00] you your audience and then you run your user persona and then you run this prompt and it'll give you your whole cohorts, all the cohorts that you need for day [00:18:10] trading attention. So, what would have normally taken you, I don't know a few hours to read the book, a few more hours to understand and apply it to your [00:18:20] business.

Now, in about three or four minutes, you have the whole thing applied. Just following the steps and you can take it one step further [00:18:30] and inside Amplify AI's, I'm going to give you access to this as well. This will just ask you [00:18:40] seven questions. You don't even have, you don't have to do the prompts. So you'll just ask you seven questions.

Like what industry are you in? What's the target audience? What's your business [00:18:50] goals? And it'll create your whole strategy. This is one that's done earlier and it just kind of made the whole thing. [00:19:00] So it creates the cohorts, it does and then you can go on ~and, and, and, and, and,~ and sort of improve from here.

But what I'm trying to get at is, you can take something that already works, [00:19:10] that takes a long time to implement, and you can simplify it to take minutes. So something that would normally have taken weeks or [00:19:20] days to implement can now can be done really, really quickly. You'll have access to this deck, so I would encourage you to go through it.

In [00:19:30] here, ~if you, ~if you also click on this link here about learning anything at speed, it'll, it, it shows you how to, how I've created an AI that will, [00:19:40] will actually teach you anything. So you can say, I want to learn how to sell on a webinar in the next. 20 minutes, or I want to learn to [00:19:50] run five K's in the next three months.

It doesn't matter what it is. It'll take it and break it down and give you the exact steps for you to execute. ~Julia has access to this. I'm sure, I'm sure she's going to give you, give you access to the deck. So just click on the links. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to to to reach out.~

Andrea Sullivan: This [00:20:00] is amazing. Thank you. Ronsley. The fact that you embed all of your decks with additional information. I mean, this was clearly a lot for us to take in, but we, I think we, everybody got. Some, [00:20:10] you know, practical ideas, but it'll be good to, you know, kind of encourage everyone as homework to go and yeah, figure out like, how, what are the kinds of things that you're looking to solve for?

[00:20:20] And you know, we can, we'd love to, you know, bring everybody back together and hear a little bit more about what are they learning? Where are they stuck? That kind of thing. And Ron's Lisa, you know, he's great because he's an [00:20:30] entrepreneur and he understands exactly what he was talking about moving from solopreneur to.

You know, kind of expanding out and bringing teams in. He's an expert at helping people to [00:20:40] figure out how people can bring AI into their, all their operating procedures and things. So please feel free to, you know, to reach out to him [00:20:50] as a, as a a VIVE alumni. Thank you, Ronsley. 

Ronsley Vaz: Of course. You're welcome.

Thank you. Ronsley, 

Andrea Sullivan: you're amazing. 

Ronsley Vaz: Thank you. 

Andrea Sullivan: We appreciate your staying [00:21:00] up so late. Our love to your to the fam. 

Ronsley Vaz: I will. Thank you. ~Fantastic. ~

Astha Avinash: ~We're gonna hop on. ~

Andrea Sullivan: ~All right, everybody. We'll hop on to the, the superpower session with Priya. ~

Ronsley Vaz: ~All right. See you team. Good to see you. ~

Andrea Sullivan: ~Thanks.~
