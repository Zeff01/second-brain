Astha Avinash: [00:00:00] everybody had a chance to meet you at the beginning.

Andrea Sullivan: And then you're just bringing in like family here. So thank you for spending the time with us. we're, everybody's all abuzz [00:00:10] about AI, but the thing I love about Ronsly is he actually, You know, kind of makes it real in the sense that he shows people how they can bring it into their day to day.

And [00:00:20] so I love whole idea of how can we embrace things and bring it practically into our businesses and into our lives. So. I'm thrilled to have you here, Ronsley.

Anyway, [00:00:30] appreciate you all being here.So our brother, Ronsley. Thank you for joining. 

Ronsley Vaz: Thank you team.

I do feel like friends and family. And [00:00:40] I'm really, really glad to have met you all in person. Last year, 

I know everyone's been asked like, what is the biggest thorn in the business? I feel [00:00:50] that AI can easily sort of start to deal with some of the problems that we've been having in our businesses for a while maybe.

And Maybe we think [00:01:00] that it's too complex a problem to solve, usually what happens is with the idea of giving AI some work [00:01:10] to do, I find in the last couple of years, the best advice I've given others is use AI for the things that you're not good at first. [00:01:20] Normally what happens is people try to use AI for the things that they're really good at, like they're really good at copy.

They try AI for that and they go, oh, AI doesn't really do the copy like the way I do it. and the [00:01:30] easiest way to get the most leverage out of AI is to Use it for the things you're not good at. what is the biggest thorn in your business?

And then you think I can help you solve, and we'll [00:01:40] get into that in a second. So a couple of things to start off with. The goal is that AI can be used a whole bunch of different things. [00:01:50] Most people think about using AI. to out beat their competitors or and I feel like there's a much better way to use AI.

Use [00:02:00] AI to amplify the things that are working really well. So for example, if you're going into doing To implementing AI, [00:02:10] integrating AI into your business, the, the, if you're doing it by yourself, the first thing to get the most leverage is to use the things that you're not good at and use AI for that.

But if you want to get [00:02:20] the biggest leverage over time for your business, if you already have processes and frameworks that work and you know how they work, using AI to [00:02:30] get it done quicker, and I'll show you some examples is probably the easiest way to get it to get the most. Out of the implementation because for the last so many [00:02:40] years, whether it was with AI or with podcasting, it's basically what I've done is taken someone's genius and amplified it.

and with both of those [00:02:50] platforms, you're actually using your genius and your greatness and amplifying it, whether it is through AI or [00:03:00] podcasting you will all get a copy of the deck, but. What you got to know is, for the first part of my career, I was talking to computers. The second part of my career, I was talking to humans.

And now, those [00:03:10] two parts have just come together and become AI. The first book was Amplify. The second book was Amplify AI. and I've spent a lot of time distilling [00:03:20] uh, what it takes to, Put your genius into a podcast and then take your genius amplify it using A.

I. But 13 years ago, maybe a bit longer. This picture was [00:03:30] 13 years ago. I was a chef in a restaurant. My first business was a restaurant because I thought everyone's got to eat. Right? And everyone told me that I had to monetize my passion. You know, this story because [00:03:40] I spoke to you guys in, in, in New York about it.

But this was just before the restaurant shot and the restaurant shot kind of overnight [00:03:50] with its service on Saturday, on Sunday, the locks were changed. And it was really interesting because that was when I learned to become an entrepreneur, to [00:04:00] find out what the market needs and then. Not necessarily build it because there's this idea of building them that they will come, which is what I did with the [00:04:10] restaurant.

Built it 260 grand down before I opened the doors and someone gave me 10 for my, for the first meal. I was like, Oh, this [00:04:20] seems hard. And it just seemed like an uphill battle from there. But now with the ability to have, you know, digital media, it's so [00:04:30] much easier. SoFor 2025, at leastopen yourself to new ideas and new ways of doing business.

I think things are changing quite drastically. I believe [00:04:40] artificial intelligence will easily be the biggest conversation of our lifetime. Things have changed already so quickly. We just got announced. Like [00:04:50] I think a few hours ago VLC is like the famous media player. It's free. It has been free forever.

VLC, you can download it and it'll play any sort of media [00:05:00] file. They have just incorporated live. Transcription as part of their free media player. So [00:05:10] transcription used to be a business where I remember paying a dollar a minute to get transcriptions because, you know, we did podcasts for like a lot of people and there was a time for us to get the [00:05:20] show notes or to create any sort of media.

We needed to pay the dollar a minute to get the transcription first. And now that is just not even a [00:05:30] thing, you know, so things are changing and I would assume that it will change in your space as well. And I would ask you to be the leader to change [00:05:40] that. I'm going to look at the chat, but what I think is really useful is, is having, having this template filled out.

All right. I am [00:05:50] X who helps Y achieve Z. I'm unique because ABC. What I might do is just put that into the, into the chat and when you [00:06:00] get a chance, if you can if you can fill out this for me for each one of you, that would be amazing. While I look at what's in here, biggest thorn in [00:06:10] our business.

That AI could help with. I'm in accounting. I feel like AI should be able to help me.

I don't know enough to Oh my God. Yeah, of course, Diana. It's going to help you. [00:06:20] It's this in accounting and numbers. But I think there's a big difference between intelligence and computing and I'll talk about that in a second. But yeah, I mean, it's super [00:06:30] helpful. Use AI for business intelligence.

Jeff, you know, clarification on what you mean by business intelligence. That would be interesting for your [00:06:40] business. Program management. Detail plans, that's easy to do. So, for the people that I hear, Jeff, Brad, Diana Diana, William, [00:06:50] Priya, if you can, if you can use that template and fill it out to the best of your abilities, I am X who helps Y achieve Z, I'm unique [00:07:00] because ABC, and the reason for that is it gives us context, and with that context we can do a lot of really cool things using AI.

And that will [00:07:10] help us use AI to sort of reverse engineer templates. So if you can, if you could fill that out and put that in the chat, that would be amazing. [00:07:20] Please.

Jeff Schuppe: Ronsley, can you give an example if this was you answering this question? 

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah, I'm an AI consultant who helps business founders [00:07:30] who have, oh, it's you. Help business founders who build something amazing to their genius into AI powered systems that actually works. So I [00:07:40] am designation who helps audience, which is why achieve Zed, which is outcome.

So I am a computer [00:07:50] an AI consultant who helps audience, which is business founders who have methods and frameworks and a business over a million dollars achieve [00:08:00] integration with AI to do things quicker and save two hours a day. Does that help?

Jeff Schuppe: Yep, that's good. 

Ronsley Vaz: Thanks. Yeah. [00:08:10] And then I can add that I'm unique because, you know, I have you know, I'm I can program 21 languages. I have written a book. I've got results. [00:08:20] You can just keep adding what those uniqueness is, are. My framework works. I have a framework that works. So the uniqueness is up to you

So the goal is that by today's [00:08:30] session, that we'll do some work in the session. the idea is that I want to not give you to have a bigger to do list than you already have, but maybe we can start to, [00:08:40] to dig into some of the things that you're trying to deal with right now. 

before we start the three main concepts I want to cover, the first is the value alignment problem.

This is a [00:08:50] problem that 

exists in Computer science and has been forever in the sense that when when a programmer goes to a client and [00:09:00] says you know, the client says, this is what I want. The programmer goes. Okay. Let me take all your requirements and I'll write them down. Then I will go away. [00:09:10] thing, test the thing, and I'll come back and I'll show you the thing done.

And that used to be called the waterfall method of creation. And what used to happen is there was a [00:09:20] value alignment problem from the way the customer described what they wanted to the way the programmer understood what needed to be made. So there's [00:09:30] this gap in specifying the objective we have in our head completely and correctly.

And. To combat that, Agile methods were [00:09:40] created. Now, luckily, I wrote a thesis in Agile methods, and what it does is it sort of breaks down that cycle from a [00:09:50] waterfall method to shorter iterations. So you have these cycles where you say, Okay, what do you want, Mr. Customer, or Mrs. Customer, or Miss Customer?[00:10:00] 

And you go, and they say, this is what I want. And you're like, okay, let me make an MVP of that. And in one week, I'll show you what that MVP looks like. And then they [00:10:10] show them the MVP and then the customer goes, Oh, yes, but not really. I kind of wanted it this way and that way. And then they make those changes and those small [00:10:20] iterations help us reduce the value alignment problem.

Does that make sense, team? Yeah. So the first concept is that it's [00:10:30] hard for us to express entirely what's in our brain. So, normally, if you're not getting what you want out of AI, it's because there's a value alignment [00:10:40] problem. Okay, that's the first concept. The second concept I want to introduce you to is the one of reducing human cognitive load.

Now, In general, [00:10:50] we can see how there is this rise of depression, anxiety, too much workload, overwhelmed. that is common. [00:11:00] And instead of using AI to replace people, use AI to reduce their cognitive load. We're all leaders here and we all lead [00:11:10] a bunch of people. And if you could give them a superpower that Would negate their biggest weakness.

You would be [00:11:20] the best thing since sliced bread.

I think that's the goal. The goal for us is how can we reduce our human cognitive load as well as that of our team. 

In terms of reduction of [00:11:30] cognitive load, you consider yourself to have human intelligence. You can augment that with artificial intelligence and then align that.

With divine intelligence for the greater good, [00:11:40] and then you can use intelligence to really make a difference in your businessin your industry for your people. know for a fact that [00:11:50] human intelligence lacks in a lot of ways. We're very bad at memory, extremely bad at memory, while artificial intelligence is really good at memory.

So. [00:12:00] Augments the intelligence in and use artificial intelligence for what it's good at and use human intelligence for what it's good at. All right. The last thing I'm going to say is wearing [00:12:10] socks. I had this friend that asked me, how do I wear my socks? And I'm like, what do you mean? One leg at a time.

And he, that's not what he was asking me. He asked me how I wear my socks in the [00:12:20] sense whether I wear my socks inside out or just like the way normal people do. It's like everyone wears the socks normally. And he goes, why would you want [00:12:30] the stitching of the socks to be on the inside for you to deal with the stitching while you're walking through your day?

Why don't you just flip the socks around? And [00:12:40] I'm like, what? That is so simple. and since then I've been wearing my socks the other way around. So for 40 years, I've been wearing socks the wrong way. [00:12:50] And I would encourage you to think. Or what I thought was the right way, but it could be one better.

while you're listening to this and we're doing today's session. I think [00:13:00] there are ways that you can wear your socks differently that will actually benefit you. 

I want you to do a brain dump, like, literally all the things you have on your mind. That you have to [00:13:10] do just say, I want to, I've got to do this. I've got to go give the dog a bath, whatever it is.

I've got to pay the team, [00:13:20] whatever is your list. I want you to go. I'm going to put a minute on the clock and I would love you to just dictate to your phone. All right. One [00:13:30] minute.

All right. How'd you go? Everyone got that note? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Now what I'd like you to do, I'm [00:13:40] going to.

open chat GPT or

you can use Claude, you can use Gemini, you can use Grok. It doesn't matter what AI you use. What I'd like you to do is [00:13:50] say. Organize this in a logical manner, and I want you to just paste, [00:14:00] just don't even correct whatever that is, just paste that in the brackets there in your AI and hit enter, please.

[00:14:10] So organize this in a logical manner, and then copy your dictation and paste it in there. How

are you going, team? Can I help?

Did [00:14:20] anyone execute already?

Yeah, Diana, do you want to unmute and tell me? 

Diana Gleason: So I literally brain dumped. This was really cool. And then it made [00:14:30] me a to do list of like my work tasks that I need to get done my self care tasks. I need to get done my personal home tasks. I broke it up into household errands and then like weekend [00:14:40] activities.

Ronsley Vaz: It's beautiful. It is. So now what I'd like you to do is I say. Say you can now you can say things like for me to feel really productive. what is the thing [00:14:50] that I could do right now to take off the list or you can ask it to organize it to home in a way, or you can ask it give me the task [00:15:00] that can be done in the in 1 minute, like, or give me the task that I need to dedicate time to and put in the calendar.

So now that you have that brain [00:15:10] dump. And it's organized for you. There's so many things that you can do, but not only that it has reduced overwhelm. If you feel like it's, if you [00:15:20] feel it, like it's something going, Oh, I've captured that somewhere. 

Diana Gleason: Yeah, yeah, this is great. Now I can be like, [00:15:30] organize this to tell me what to do on Saturday and what to do on Sunday.

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah, yeah, 

So this is something that you can totally use, [00:15:40] right? You can totally use that as soon as you feel overwhelmed. The first thing I want you to do is pick up your phone, open the notes. And just brain dump [00:15:50] all the things that you have on your mind, even that act in itself is going to reduce the overwhelm.

Then the next thing from there is to take that and then organize that in a logical manner. And [00:16:00] then the next thing from there is to take that and then execute on the things. And in that, just in that, you're going to start to reduce a lot of your human [00:16:10] cognitive load. You'll feel less tired. Okay. So what I've noticed over the last couple of years, implementing AI.

Different companies and different [00:16:20] businesses that there are these. Three S's that stop us from implementing AI properly. The first is that there's scaling limits in business. There's [00:16:30] scaling limits. Like we can't scale without human hours. And that's a problem that we need to fix. The second problem is that there's a system overwhelm.

[00:16:40] There's lots of AI options and there's lots of complexity and everyone seems to know what they're talking about and everyone's an expert. So we just kind of go and we see these tools and we start getting tools [00:16:50] and there's new things coming out every day and every week and we're like, I don't even know what to do next.

That's the second problem to solve. And the third is [00:17:00] that there's a strategy gap because there's no clear. AI implementation strategy. So for us to overcome that, the first thing to do is to overcome scaling limits is to create [00:17:10] connection. Now, connection is the ability to amplify human connection while scaling and not that every company knows how difficult that is, but with AI, [00:17:20] it can be made easier.

The second thing is with System Overwhelm is to have clarity and a clear AI implementation roadmap and with the strategy, [00:17:30] you increase capability and deploy proven systems that already exist and not you're trying to create new ones for yourself [00:17:40] for each of these. Now, there's like these. three Ps for each of them.

So for connection, you, you first want to extract personality, [00:17:50] and then you want to make sure that you have a way to check the style and consistency. And then there is a way to train your AI. [00:18:00] To do exactly what you wanted to do that's how you create connection to create clarity. You first map all the processes that work, [00:18:10] then you create, you insert AI into those processes and create architecture and then use the pyramid.

And I've written about that in detail in the book, [00:18:20] so I don't really want to go into the pyramid part, but I'm just giving you an overview of. What happens when you're trying to implement A. I. into your business. And [00:18:30] finally, once you have connection and clarity to implement capability, you start implementing the A.

I. Tools and then start to determine performance and increase [00:18:40] productivity. So that is the way to actually implement in the right steps. But what happens right now is people go straight [00:18:50] to tools and they start buying the tool and then the tool doesn't do what it's supposed to do. And then you go back and forth.

And in the meantime, you've lost connection with your team. You've [00:19:00] lost connection with your audience and you've lost connection with yourself because you're trying to fit this tool into the system as opposed to [00:19:10] getting the right tool for your system. so Flip that around.
