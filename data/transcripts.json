    "transcript": "Sequence\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~ Hello, everybody,~\n\n~Michael, Laura, and just joining. I'll be Sandra.~\n\nAnnalisa: ~How are you this evening, everyone else doing ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~well? How are you? We can't see you. You can see a beautiful cake.~\n\nAnnalisa: ~Yeah, I'm getting ready. Get online. I just have 1 delivery. I'll be back on in a minute. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~No worries. No worries. Good to hear your voice.~\n\nAnnalisa: ~Good morning. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Hey, Annalisa. Good to see you. ~\n\nAnnalisa: ~Likewise. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Same here. How are you? I'm doing well. Not as warm as you are, so I apologize for the blanket, but All good. I had to, I had to put the air conditioning on. Maybe, maybe the heat will come through the screen. Yeah, it's meant to be winter. That's interesting.~\n\n~It's hilarious. Good to see you, Scott, Snobby, Darren ~ [00:00:00] Today's session is all around deep seek. ~And obviously deep seek is that, like, a lot in the news and again, if you're just joining us, please in the chat where you're joining us from and what are your questions around deep seek so that we can get to the end of it.~\n\nI've got a lot to get through and my goal for today. ~Is to ~to cover what deep seek is all about and why it's such a big deal.~ Sorry, Tim. I'm trying to do admin at the same time and allow people in. ~I'm going to talk about. The AI [00:00:10] model evolution, and there's been ~a,~ an evolution of models from the, you know, first time GPT 3 came out and there's been a big change in how the models have been have been coming [00:00:20] out and the types of models and how.\n\nTo prompt those models have changed as well, so I want to talk about that and we'll talk about how you can get support. I'm going to talk about 3 waves of [00:00:30] scale, how to use deep seek and I think most importantly, ~which most people have kind of signed in. But to this, webinar for is~ how to install it on your computer without using it ~ ~in the web, how to not give away your privacy, how to not give away your data, [00:00:40] how to use it without the Internet.\n\nAnd some use cases that I think is going to be very, very valuable. ~ ~~ If you don't know what I do, I kind of really focus on helping. Founders take their genius what I mean by that is. Whatever it is that they have already built and has been working. And put that into a systems. And before this you know, for 12 years, I've been creating podcasts for some really amazing people and still do.~\n\n~In fact, we still have, we are podcast. So, in terms of amplification, I've been kind of in this space of taking people's genius and their business and, and, and finding ways to get noticed and get seen and get and grow the business. So, it's like the 1st, part of my career and the 2nd, part of my career just came together and had a baby with AI, because I was doing podcasts for so long.~\n\n~And then, and AI, even though AI feels new, I've been a computer scientist for a long time and. It's a, it's a really good mix of both worlds that have just come together. So, let's just get into some of the, some of the, some of the, the content. ~~While I do that, I wanna check the chat. Welcome everyone who's joining us.~\n\n~You're just joining us in the chat. If you can tell us where you're tuning in from and what kind of questions you have when it comes to. Open ai welcome Laura. Southern California. Would love to see how it's better and faster different than chat GPT. Yep. I'm gonna cover that. Not showing a deep sequence until it's been around for a while.~\n\n~the yeah, but I think the types of models are interesting NABI.~ So, deep seek, in particular re-released [00:00:50] its reasoning model, which is the R one model, which has created all the hype. Even though deep seek had been out for a long time. So it's the type of model that is changed and [00:01:00] it's not necessarily a deep seek situation, but it's more about how the different types of models have changed from response to instructions to reasoning.\n\n~Okay. Compare and contrast DeepSeq with other known others. Yes, Scott. Sandra, welcome from Puerto Rico. Michael from Melbourne. My only exposure to DeepSeq is via Perplexity. I'd love to know where you'd recommend, where you'd recommend accessing outside of Perplexity and how to best use it versus other LLFs.~\n\n~Yep, we'll cover that. Vegas, Maryland, Rosie. Welcome. Welcome. What's all the hype about interested in privacy issues? I'm just trying to see if there's anything in here that I'm not going to cover. So how does it compare to flawed AI? And does it support multiple documents and reference databases? We'll find out Robert.~\n\n~So today I'm going to, we're going to do it together and see how we go. Some of us is trained, chat GPT sound like this. How do we transfer that over? Yeah, I'll show you that. Okay. ~~Regarding privacy, so it's a lot of privacy questions. You don't even have to I can guarantee you the stuff I'm going to show you today.~\n\n~You don't even have to use the DeepSeek website for you're going to install it locally on your computer. You're going to have access to DeepSeek. Without the Internet as well, which is what. I think when I put it out on socials, and I said, I installed steep seek on my computer locally. That was got a lot of attention.~\n\n~I was like, oh, if I run a, if I run a webinar or a training on that, would that be useful? And then obviously this became a thing. So, I'm~~ going to show you how to do that. James, of course. It's worth using. Yeah, I'm going to show you without to, you know, the question from most of these was about deep seek about privacy.~\n\n~I'm going to show you how to do that without even worrying about that. It's a Mac compatible. Yes. Don't have a M1 chip on my MacBook. Amazing. So, welcome. Welcome everyone. What I want to talk about first initially is just sort of set the stage and show you some of the things that have changed in in, in the AI world, starting with the different types of models.~\n\nSo we first, when [00:01:10] GPT 3 came out, we had basic prompt response interactions, sort of models. Then with the evolution of that, we wanted to get things [00:01:20] Better so we started going after prompt prompt engineering and specific. Steps of prompts were a big deal. Everyone started buying a lot of prompt packs and kind of [00:01:30] work on that.\n\nAnd now we've got to a point where we've got a that thinks like a team member. So we have obviously evolved quite a bit. ~In ~in the change, I'll show [00:01:40] you what the differences are, right? So, in the basic type of prompting, when it 1st came out, it was basically. You know, someone who could follow exact steps.\n\nIt was just you [00:01:50] sending a prompt and getting a response back. And a lot of our time was being spent on correcting things. So, there was a lot of, oh, this is not exactly what I want, [00:02:00] but. I'm going to spend a lot of time~ trying to trying to trying to. ~Trying to correct the output, ~ ~then we got very specific with, you know, telling it exactly what to do with the detailed engineering prompts and.[00:02:10] \n\nAnd you will get a good response, but it kind of creates this bottleneck where there's a human required in the process. And by the way, I'm not by no stretch of the imagination [00:02:20] saying that we've gotten to a point right now where human intervention is not required. But it is closer to that than it has ever been.\n\nOkay. [00:02:30] So, in this case, there was a lot of human intervention required. And now we've got into the reasoning models where it's, you know, you can truly [00:02:40] scale your business intelligence. And I'm very specific about your business intelligence. So what's happening right now is. People are outsourcing [00:02:50] intelligence by finding it on the Internet and then using intelligence to amplify it.\n\nAnd that's why it sounds rubbish, and that's why it sounds generic,~ and that's why it sounds like, ~and that's why most people are saying that, [00:03:00] oh, that's AI content. It's AI content. It's not your amplification of your voice or your thoughts or ~your ~your genius. And that's where you want to get to. And [00:03:10] in this space here.\n\nIt's like really having someone who can think for themselves and recorrect themselves. And in DeepSeek R1, this is [00:03:20] great in the paper, when they released the paper, the research paper, there's this, it's called the aha moment inside the reasoning model, which made the [00:03:30] huge hype. And the aha moment was the model saw itself.\n\nSo it was [00:03:40] almost sentient in a way that it saw itself and recorrected itself in its reasoning. And that was the aha moment and that that's what became the big deal. ~So if you look it up the aha moment in the R1 deep seek you, you know, if you want to read more about that. ~So [00:03:50] the models have changed over time.\n\n~Okay. And in this space. ~And in this space, Gemini actually had a reasoning model 2 months ago. It wasn't a big deal because it didn't really [00:04:00] shatter much of the expectations. Open AI came out with 0. 1 in December, ~and it came out with when~ came out with it, they came out with it during the time of the 12 days [00:04:10] AI, and it came out like a great feature, but didn't really hit the reasoning capabilities like old tree has right now and obviously deepseek.\n\nSo [00:04:20] if you're looking for support, there's a lot of support out there. You know, we've got the podcast. It's got over 100 episodes in there. And videos, it's actually a video podcast. So. [00:04:30] Go to the YouTube channel and find everything from prompting to how to use it in a particular instance. If you're looking, there are episodes on how to set business [00:04:40] goals using AI, how to do a whole bunch of different things.\n\nSo, especially for business, go check out the podcast. Definitely get the book. If you're looking, if you have a business and you're looking to sort of [00:04:50] accelerate that on the website, you'll find all sorts of resources, including prompt packs and, ~and, and~ one lines that will change your. AI [00:05:00] experience drastically.\n\nSo go find that amplifyais. com is that website. And then inside our school community, which a lot of [00:05:10] you are here from we've got a whole bunch of events coming on. It's usually the same time my Thursday, your Wednesday, if you're in the States or if you're [00:05:20] in Australia, it's Thursday as well. So. These are all Brisbane times that you can see here and there's obviously a few events coming up.\n\nSo go [00:05:30] check that out. I want to talk about 3 waves of scale really quickly. So we can get into the deep thing ~who here just a show of hands who here has seen me talk about the 3 different. Ages the different ways of scale, so, the industrial age. The information age and intelligence age. Yeah, I'm just going to repeat it really quickly so that everyone here knows what I'm talking about.~\n\n~So we've had the industrial age. Hey, Chris, I can see you in convenience little box. We, ~~we've had the industrial age and in the industrial age, we commoditized industry. So we've got a lot of machines around us right now that we're taking for granted, but that all came as a result of the. That's great.~\n\n~Built on that industrial age, we gave rise to computers, and because of computers, we needed to store data, and as a result of data, we found a way to store data easily, so information age came around. And we had, we commoditized information. There's no shortage of information right now. And built on the industrial age and the intelligence age, sorry, the industrial age and the information age.~\n\n~We now have the intelligence age, and they've both were needed to create this intelligence because we needed the hardware and the software to come up to the level of intelligence. And this, this is really interesting clip I saw recently where Jimmy Kyle was asked about AI and his thoughts about AI.~\n\n~And he said, I think that man's of humans, I idea of God and something being real, like someone in the clouds that knows everything and is omnipotent and omnipresent, that we've had this need that we've gone and created AI, which is harder in its image. So that's a really interesting thought. I experiment on that, but you see the different ages and that's really important to understand that intelligence is not information.~\n\n~Intelligence builds on information and it's things for itself. It's a silicon based life form and it can do really cool things.~~ So,~ so the three waves of scale. Yesterday I ran this a lot yesterday last week around this [00:05:40] really great. Workshop~ on ~on taking out what's in your head and putting it on a little framework and I got some really good results from that.\n\nIf you want access to [00:05:50] that, you'll find it on the Amplify AI's website on the products and services. It's the AI amplification blueprint. Got some really, really good sort of [00:06:00] results from that. And I really, really want you to check it out. So go check that out. All ~ ~resources and slides for this session will be in the school community.\n\nThat's the QR [00:06:10] code. Just go to school dot com slash Amplify AI. There are three main concepts that I wanted to get before we get into deepseek the first is there is [00:06:20] a gap. It is a value alignment problem. The value alignment problem is the gap in our way of expressing exactly what's in our head [00:06:30] in words.\n\nOr expressing that correctly in diagrams or whatever that is. So there's a big gap and that's called the value alignment problem. That's [00:06:40] most of the reason why we think AI hallucinates. It's because we have this gap in expressing exactly what we want out of AI. ~First concept. ~Second concept is [00:06:50] use AI to reduce human cognitive load.\n\nSo the things that take you time and energy to process, that's what you want to [00:07:00] use. AI for use it as an augmentation of intelligence and the 3rd ~contact ~concept is. ~Oops, that ~context is king and process is queen. And if, you [00:07:10] know. Anything about chess, you know, that Queen is the most most important piece on the board.\n\nAnd while context is really, really important and you've got to protect [00:07:20] context ~with context ~with everything you have. The process. Is really, really important. So the tools are not as important as the processes. ~Okay. So, while you're here, what I want to do before I go into the compass, so I'll talk about deep sea.~\n\n~So check the chat for a sec.~\n\n~Can I just find out from everyone in here what what what what stood out from the last 15 minutes of presentation like what did you get standing. Did anything hit? If you can put that in the chat, that'd be really useful. While I look at this, find DeepSeek ~\n\nGMT20250205-225709_Recording_as_2560x1440: ~globally. Yes. Yes. One.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Okay. Right. Process is green. Okay. Thank you. All right. So there's a few things that~ the few reasons why [00:07:30] DeepSeek has obviously made such a big impact. The first is actually more than the powerful performance. It is the affordable [00:07:40] training costs that makes it kind of really insane. So what. Open AI has been saying for all this while, including Sam Altman, actually [00:07:50] very cockily, you know, a lot of presentations when he has been asked,~ well, what if we don't have,~ what if we don't have you know, a hundred million dollars to train models, what do you do?\n\nAnd [00:08:00] he was very cocky and said, well, you just don't compete with us. And\n\nthat clip actually didn't age very well. So, ~what,~ what is really [00:08:10] fascinating about DeepSea is that it costs. Like 6 million to get the results that, that I suppose open AI to, you know, [00:08:20] 100 million and more to get to, and obviously they have to justify where the, ~you know, the the~ investment and where it goes, ~but it costs like really, ~so what that means is as soon as deep [00:08:30] sea came out, actually.\n\nOpen AI, the next day came out with with 01, the reasoning model being available on the free plan. [00:08:40] So, they've also just dropped API costs by a tenth, a tenth of what it used to be. So, what's happening now with [00:08:50] DeepSea. Is that everyone's trying not to compete with this new kid on the block and as a result, we are the beneficiaries because it is you [00:09:00] know, it's spreading more opportunity.\n\nThe 2nd, ~most 2nd, most,~ most important feature is that it outperforms in a lot of instances, the models that are [00:09:10] running out of the U. S. Which, by the way, I hear today or yesterday that the U. S. are planning to put a, like, a 20 year prison [00:09:20] sentence on anyone that in the U. S. that uses deep sea.\n\n~That show~ that's crazy. That's fear. It's at the highest level. That's insane. I can't [00:09:30] even. I don't even know how they think this is a great idea. Like it's intelligence.~ It's like, ~I suppose that's the only way that they're going to stop progress of where AI is going ~is,~ is [00:09:40] put this kind of crazy, crazy ~ ~fines or ~ ~barricades to use it. \n\nThe third is, ~you know, it,~ it can be run on laptops and phones. It doesn't require that kind of [00:09:50] high data. ~So I lo~ I saw a lot of ~M1.~ I don't have an M1 stuff chip. And you might not need an M1 chip, but you gotta go, you gotta install it to find out [00:10:00] what kind of performance ~it,~ it'll give you. And for me the most important feature ~of,~ of deep seek is that ~it's open, open source.~\n\n~It's, it's, ~it's open source. OpenAI, called OpenAI, this is [00:10:10] American marketing at its finest. It's called OpenAI, but it's closed all the way through. You don't know anything about the model. They haven't released anything. We don't know anything [00:10:20] about how it works. ~We just have to accept whatever it is.~\n\n~And ~DeepSea comes out, does it~ in, you know, ~in kind of a fraction of the cost, and then releases everything and makes it open source. Which is very, very [00:10:30] powerful. So what that gives rise to is that it doesn't have to be massive to be powerful, which is where it's going. Right. You see how intelligence has been commoditized and it's freely [00:10:40] available.\n\n~And I wanted to think about this for all of those of you who have kids we when a child is a human child is born on the planet, we send them to school for 12 years, at least to learn how to operate on this planet. And they learn everything from, you know, physics, chemistry, math, history geography, and so on.~\n\n~But that intelligence is available for free right now. And if that competed with anyone in the class, it would help beat them in every exam. So intelligence is being commoditized. ~It's not like a myth. It is. It's already here. It proves that AI can be trained for a fraction of the cost and it doesn't require big models and it doesn't require big.\n\nChips that's why [00:10:50] NVIDIA stocks dropped. Like, I think they lost like a trillion and more in stocks or what wiped off the NASDAQ primarily because assumption [00:11:00] was that we required those NVIDIA chips and only those GPU chips. Would be able to train the AI models and then deep sea comes out and says, [00:11:10] no, we can do it and it can just be used like that.\n\n~Like this.~ And they've got a really cool way of doing it by the way, and I don't think I'm going to get into that because it's like, really out [00:11:20] of the scope, but you've got to read that paper and the research paper that came out and it's really fascinating on how they use the aha moment, the reasoning.\n\n[00:11:30] So, Yeah. Open source and ~not all, you know, and which ~which is something that we all want. We want everything to be open source that we can build on the intelligence. So to [00:11:40] install deep seek locally we're going to download and install. Oh, llama. We're going to pull deepseek and let me show you what that looks like.\n\n~So, for everyone here, if you can go to~\n\n~your browser, Okay. And you're going to type olama. com.~\n\n~Okay, and you're just going to download your version whether it is for mac or windows I think most of you might be on mac then if you're on windows, you're going to download that i'm just going to look at the chat So if you want me to slow down, let me know but so you're going to come and you're going to download olama As soon as you download that you're going to run it and install it and then you will get a little Lama on the top of your bar here~\n\n~is everyone. I'm going to I'm going to get you to do this with me. Okay. It's rather than do we need we need terminal at some point. Yes. But right now we just,~ you just go to a browser [00:11:50] type O L L A M A dot com and you're going to come here and find download and then download Olama [00:12:00] and then install it and then you should get this Lama up the top here.\n\n~Great question about Olama and terminal.~\n\n~Chris, I don't know. We'll find out. So you can install it. And we'll see how it runs and what will happen is at the very least, it'll run, I think. But it might be slow. So, otherwise, maybe it's time to get the new silicon chips are like really ridiculous. It's taken, taken computing to a worrying level.~\n\n~Yeah.~\n\n~Okay, ~you install Allama, ~ ~you are gonna go. ~ ~And type [00:12:10] this ~into the chat into the,~ into the terminal. ~So, if you,~ if you have terminal.\n\nNot if you have to give the max, sorry, you're going to go into terminal. So, open spotlight. So, [00:12:20] come on space terminal and open terminal. And you're going to type this means.\n\nOkay. So, when [00:12:30] you do that, what it's going to do is it's going to start downloading. Mine is already downloaded before. So. It's already running here and if I type~ I mean, it'll, ~it'll run ~ ~through the thinking [00:12:40] and then, so this is running already because it's already downloaded for all of you right now. When you run this, run deep C, [00:12:50] R1 7B, except the ones who are already running. \n\n~Yeah, James, it's already in the chat. It's the, it's, it's the, literally the 1 above. Your comment in the chat is, is the command in the chat.~\n\nSo what's really interesting about ~ ~these thinking models ~is, is, ~is before it even ~does the, or ~starts [00:13:00] writing ~the,~ article, which is quite simple, write me an article on supercomputers, it does this thinking and you can read through the thinking and see [00:13:10] how it's coming to this conclusion of what it should write.\n\nThank you very much. And it's very detailed. Look at the thinking, right? And then it's [00:13:20] gone. Okay, now I'm writing my article on supercomputers based on the thinking. ~So, the point is, no, it is not Mike. And I'm going to show you how to, how to, to get a a UI going. But the main thing I want you to see is is, is that you have Olama running.~\n\n~Okay?~ So that's the 1st thing just want to have a llama [00:13:30] running.\n\n~Is anyone running into issues with, with having that Obama installed? You got great spot. You must have really good and if you're going to install, then you installed it now. Fantastic. Okay, great. So it's quite simple. And Chris, if it's still in progress, it's fine. Just follow the steps, right? So it's, it's just 1 command after the other.~\n\nSo once it installed, if you look here, what I've done is upon and. Run this command called olama list. And what [00:13:40] it's showing you is all the other models I have also installed here. ~So I can, I can do olama run lama 3. Okay. And now if I say, me and article on supercomputers. It'll just write the, it'll just write the article.~\n\n~So this is the big difference between this model, and the thinking model of our one before where they look. There was thinking involved without, you know, this is just kind of gone and started writing the writing the article without any thinking.~ So there's different models that you can, you can run on all our and there are models that you can run on [00:13:50] all our, which I'll show you, which they are, that are uncensored, which means you can download it on your computer, kill the Internet, start [00:14:00] running the model, which is actually called it's this Mistral model that's here, Dolphin Mistral, which And you can ask it anything, like, [00:14:10] how do I make explosives?\n\nAnd it, it will tell you. ~So there's every,~ so it's uncensored. There's no censoring in what you can ask [00:14:20] it which is actually what you want. ~So, so~ on the left hand side, you can see my OLAMA screen, ~which I'm just going to enlarge, but on the, on the left,~ up the top, you click on models, you'll see all the different models that you can get [00:14:30] on OLAMA.\n\n~There's~~,~ there's still a lot. Lama 3. 3 just got out to release. I didn't even know that. But there is ~a lot,~ a lot of models that you can install on your computer [00:14:40] now ~in, in, in the, in the chat. I, I've got a lot about, I've got a lot of questions about M1 and but it can run M1. I would say there will be smaller models in here that you could potentially do the same thing and run on your computer.~\n\nIf you ~have,~ don't have a chip or the chip that you're using does not run deep seq well, ~so you,~ you can choose a smaller model there, like see a Gemma two, be two, [00:14:50] 2 billion per parameter model. ~Will, will,~ will run I, I'm assuming you are, it's a Quin 0.5 billion per model. So there are smaller models here that you could [00:15:00] potentially install on your computer and still use without the internet and have intelligence for free on your laptop.\n\nAnd that's the goal. ~Okay. So now,~ so we've got Allama installed which is great, [00:15:10] which means we actually already have intelligence on the computer ~and,~ and as a result of getting Allama installed, we've then installed R1, [00:15:20] and now we have DeepSeq available on our computer, and we've got DeepSeq, the 7B model.\n\nIf you look here on the [00:15:30] left hand side, if you click on DeepSeq, you'll see that there are. There's a lot of models. This is the largest model. Now, this is the [00:15:40] top of the line, even my computer cannot run it. And I've got an M2 with 96 GB RAM to give you an idea [00:15:50] of the computer that's running right now.\n\nAnd even that won't be able to take this. ~So, ~so I'm running a 7g model because that's the most stable and ~you can choose anything you would choose. You could choose potentially~ if it's not running great. You could [00:16:00] use a 1.\n\n5\n\nbillion per minute a month. ~I see the Tiananmen Square comment. This is really interesting because a really good friend of mine in Brisbane runs a, runs a, a newsletter called Pod News James is his name and James put out this post about DeepSea and how, you know, it, it is removing certain, oh, it doesn't talk about certain instances, but And my comment to that was the Chinese are learning from the British to pretend that history didn't happen, which is totally true.~\n\n~Right. And it's interesting that now we're talking about certain things, but there are certain things in general from history that has been wiped out because it was written by the victors. So, ~all these things about certain elements. Don't really worry about that because If you think about how much [00:16:10] censorship goes into open AI, DeepSeek doesn't even come close to that.\n\n~Not even,~ not even a fraction, like. Open AI senses everything. [00:16:20] So you can't even for example, you can't even, you can't even ask it a question about your own x ray as an example. So ~they are, ~they are kind of like [00:16:30] really babying down the models for usage in the US, which is interesting. So you want to find different ways to use it, and you want to find what works, and [00:16:40] these are all really good tests to see how, how tainted the model is.\n\nAnd there's always going to be an issue with [00:16:50] bias, which is what you've got to, you know, make sure doesn't exist. Okay, so we have this running. The next thing I want you to do is go into [00:17:00] app. docker. com. ~Okay, app. docker. com. And~ you're going to download the Docker desktop. ~So you're going to go download and~ then you're going to pick ~ ~which is yours and then you're going to go and download and [00:17:10] install. \n\n~I'm going to put that in the chat as well.~\n\n~Yeah, Jen's yours is not, is not slow because of your MacBook Pro. Your, it's slow because it is using the internet as well at the same time. So you're doing the video and that's why it's taking, it's fine when it completes it's, it'll really just, it's good. So you can pay attention to this stuff, but you can still download Docker, by the way, and so do that.~\n\n~So download Docker, install it,~ and once you install it, you will come and open it \n\n~and it'll look something like that, just. Open it,~\n\n~you don't have to worry about it. ~Okay, so just install docker sign in. I think you can just [00:17:20] use your. Gmail, Google and sign in and just keep that in.~ And if anyone, everyone's got Docker installed or a few of you have got installed, let me know so that we can go on to the next step.~\n\n~And I'm just going to tell you what Docker is while everyone's here. ~Docker allows you to run an environment in a little container on your computer. So you're going to, we're going to [00:17:30] create a small container to run as a UI. ~On your~ on your laptop or computer. ~And if I open my docker, I've done a few things in here over time, which is if you remember a few months ago and tropical Claude released computer usage, so, you know, it would, you could literally like what operator is on on on chat, you could do that on your computer locally and I had a little docker container so To get that going, but it's not really,~ you don't have to really worry about what it [00:17:40] does.\n\nThen it just creates a little container. So you can have access to whatever it is you're going to install next. ~Okay, so can I, yeah, so you're going to go once you go to app. docker. com, you're going to come here to Docker Desktop. So, innovate with Docker Desktop, or actually, maybe I'll just give you this link.~\n\n~I'll give you this link.~\n\n~And you should just go to download and it should take you to this screen here, and then you just download your version of Docker for your computer.~\n\n~Just use recommended settings.~\n\nOkay, so once you have Docker installed, which is very [00:17:50] straightforward, the next thing you're going to go and do is you're going to go to this website.\n\n~You're going to go to the link I said above, Susan, and you're going to download it from there. Or you go into Google and say download Docker for Mac, and you should get a link. Should be straightforward. Yeah.~ So, at the top I've put a link to OpenWebUI. This is a GitHub [00:18:00] page. Now, for those who are not technically inclined GitHub is the place for geeks and I've been living on GitHub [00:18:10] for a long time and no one's even known GitHub existed, but GitHub has all repositories of everyone that has open source stuff.\n\nSo, one of the really cool [00:18:20] people that have done and given this out for free is open, open web UI, which is very useful. Once you go here, you're going to scroll [00:18:30] all the way down. Don't let any of this stuff intimidate you. If you're not technically inclined, you're just going to scroll all the way down until you come [00:18:40] here\n\nto Quick Start with Docker. ~Quick Start with Docker is~ where you're going to go. ~ ~And you're going to come down here ~ ~to Installation with Default Configuration. [00:18:50] And you're going to say ~ ~this command. ~ ~When you copy that command, you're going to come\n\nInto your terminal and it's going to paste that [00:19:00] down the bottom. \n\n~Okay. And when you, I mean, ~mine is already running. That's why it's telling me that I have to stop the container, but my container is already running. You won't have~ that ~this message that will come up. [00:19:10] It'll just start running. Okay. And what will happen is that in Docker, it'll say. You'll have this green and it'll be running. \n\n~So~\n\n~now I'm going to put that again. Yeah, that's no problem in the chat. This command. Is here in the chat, ~but again, the way to find the one is [00:19:20] go to the GitHub page that I put up the top and then you're going to scroll all the way down until you find quick start with Docker. You're going to [00:19:30] copy this on your computer, use this command, which is that we've got a lot more installed.\n\nYou have Docker installed, so we're just going to copy this command and going to put that [00:19:40] into the terminal here. And we're going to run it as soon as you run it. In docker, you're going to get this green symbol. [00:19:50] Okay. And it'll show you that it's created this link on this link is a link called local post [00:20:00] full of 3000.\n\nYou don't even have to type that you go to docker. You'll see a link here. You can just click on that. ~ ~And what you [00:20:10] have here is a UI version of. ~Okay, so ~on the left hand side of the top, you'll see. [00:20:20] You see the different models that I have installed, \n\n~you saw the 3. 1. So whatever I had access to,~\n\n~whatever I had access to here is here's the same models. Here's the list of my models. ~The same models are here so I can pick whatever model I want, which is a deep seek [00:20:30] and~ can go~\n\n~and now it'll have deep seek.~ Now, this, by the way, deep seek is not the deep seek that is. On the website. [00:20:40] So whatever you have here, this is the deep security. Go to chat. deepseek. com. ~This is the ~this is the deep seat on the web and you can definitely [00:20:50] use it. It's obviously a different model, but this is everything on this, by the way.\n\nAnd I have their~ privacy, ~the privacy statement. ~So it's really not.~\n\n~And ~it's really important to know [00:21:00] that we hear what information we collect. We collect your information in 3 ways information you provide automatically collected information and information from other sources.~ More details provided below. They're not even telling you, ~they're [00:21:10] not even hiding the fact that they're taking your information or they're storing your information.\n\nThey are storing your information. And they're also telling you how they're going to use the information. [00:21:20] And what they do with the information. ~So, in their privacy, a very clear ~unlike open a eyes privacy, which is, which is actually written by probably a bunch of lawyers. That makes it super difficult to understand.\n\n[00:21:30] But here they're very clear about, ~about, about their, ~about their model and what it does. ~So,~ so what we're doing here is just avoiding this whole situation. [00:21:40] We're not actually using anything on the web. So we've gone and installed it on our computer, ~and now we just have it here. Which means, whatever you see here, so once it's installed, you can switch off the internet, which I'm not going to do now because all of you will disappear.~\n\n~And I can still use, I can still use this. Now, the great thing about the way we've installed, Intelligence on my computer today is that I can change the model and I can go, say, into Mistral here and say, I want help to learn how to make explosives ~\n\nGMT20250205-225709_Recording_as_2560x1440: ~or a science project.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~So, in general, you wouldn't get this response in any on any. Large language model it will not tell you like this is Whatever you're doing stop. It's dangerous. Don't do it But this is on your computer and you can it's got you got different types of models. I'm using Lara, I have a I have a learn any skill one in here so I can say me to sell~\n\n~in 20 minutes a day or five days So what it'll do is it this is a this is a model that I have built Myself, and it will use This will use Tim Ferris's breakdown of a skill and create the 8020 and give me exactly what to do in the time to learn the skill. That I need, so if I can give it the time, it'll break it up into the 8020 of the skill and then tell me, okay, this, if that's the time, this is what you need to.~\n\n~To focus on so it'll do that for anything you can do that. I want to learn. I want to learn to run. In the next it'll do the same thing.~\n\n~So, ~the great thing ~about,~ about installing intelligence, the way we've just done this is is that you have access [00:21:50] to all this on your laptop and computer. ~So,~\n\n~okay. A Michael, you did a great job.~\n\n~Okay, let's do some debugging. Mike, do you wanna share your screen and show me what's happening?~\n\n~Michael, this is a great breakdown here, by the way. So everyone, can you copy and paste the steps that Michael's put in here? Thank you for my Michael for that. That's perfect.~\n\n~Can I, can we debug what's happening? So can you show us what's going on? You say when I run the copied script, nothing happens. What are you talking about?~\n\n~What are you supposed to do in OpenAI? Open web, you mean web UI? What's your habit going? You just use it as And now you have it installed on your computer, so you just go into deep seat and start a new chat.~\n\n~You can even set it as a default model, so every time you open a new chat, it'll just be deep seat. And then you use it as a normal, so it's free, so now you don't even have to pay for your chat GPT. So the command, the command is~\n\n~Yeah, just, just click. Yeah, just no, don't don't even copy that just on the right hand side. There's a copy button. Click that. Yep. Right.~\n\n~You're going to come out of this. So you just want to say slash in the terminal, Mike slash by you're going to know, you're not going to, I'm going to paste it here. I'm going to slash by B, Y, E,~\n\n~B, B for backs. B for balls.~\n\n~Enter. Now type the command. Now, now, yeah, enter.~\n\n~Okay, great. So, Ladies and gentlemen, if that's happening for you, then it's, you're probably inside Olama and that's what that's what it was doing. So Mike was already inside Olama and putting the command in. So Olama was going, oh, this is really cool. Let me think about it. That's what was happening.~\n\n~So you got to exit out of Olama and install Docker on your, just on your terminal, just in a plain promise.~\n\n~So, Susan, there's a list of steps to follow that Michael has put up the top and you just follow that. Okay, team. Any last questions before we go?~\n\n~Michael, by the way, this is, this is amazing. Thank you so much for this synopsis. This is great. I'm going to put it again in here.~\n\n~It's in the chat, Sandra, where you just type this stuff. Yeah, to exit. It's slash file.~\n\n~All right, any questions team can I get some quick thoughts before we wind this up? What did you get? What is the thing that stood out the most in today's session? If anyone wants to unmute themselves and and use your voice, that would be amazing.~\n\n~No, it'll pull it. So, as soon as it says, unable to find, if you look at my screen, it said the same thing, but then it started downloading. It should download straight away.~\n\n~Yeah, so the next thing, if you can unmute yourself and let me know what you got out of this, it would be great.~\n\n~Anyone?~\n\nJames: ~Hey everyone, it's Lance James. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Hey ~\n\nJames: ~James. This was very enlightening. I think I've got about 90 percent there, which is sometimes what I've, where I've found myself in these geeky install processes on my computer, but then I get blocked. So, and, and so I actually don't know where to get to hello James, how can I help you today?~\n\n~As on my local host, I got lost, so I kind of did most of it and went through, but then the final step, which is kind of the most important one, is I'm lost. So that's kind of an acknowledgement of progress, but also a frustration of ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~where, where, where'd you say you lost that? So you might have to restart your computer after installed Docker, and that's probably where the, the issue is.~\n\n~Okay, ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~so, so, but where do I actually find local host? 3000. Is that in a browser window? ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~You just, yeah, in a browser window. You just type local hosts three. Colon 3000. ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~Okay, ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~or when it's running when you have docker running I wonder if I just shut docker down ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~like that. It comes up with Safari calculator the server.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~So normally if you have localhost 3000, this is what will happen huh So what you want to do is come into~\n\n~And you're just going to paste that command of docker slash run using open ai you're going to copy this And paste that here. I think enter. ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~Was that the one from github? Oh, that's the command from github. Okay. So I can click clear in the, in the just click clear in, in the terminal. Correct. And then copy that again.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Correct. So, so what it's saying right now is that Docker is not running, which means, you know, if I go, I need to open Docker up.~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~What's the command for clear? Because it says I don't know what you mean. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Just clear. Are you on a, are you on a computer? ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~Yeah, I'm in terminal. And it says it seems like you're trying to reset or clear something. Could you clarify what you'd like me to do? ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Oh, you're still in Olama. So you go slash by there.~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~Oh, slash by. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah,~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~I got to ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~run because I've got another meeting right now. Yeah, no worries. ~\n\nSpeaker 2: ~Well, that's really helpful. Well, I'm almost there. Hopefully this will be. So what I'm ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~going to do is what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this from scratch. I'm going to do a little video and it's going to be in the, in the in the school community.~\n\n~Okay, so, if anyone gets, if anyone gets stuck or watch that, I'm going to start all the way from scratch and remove everything from my computer. And then I'll, I'll record that so that you can see what that looks like. All right. Thanks. Oh, you're very welcome team. Good to see everyone. Thank you for being here.~\n\n~Talk soon. Love you long time. ~\n\nAnnalisa: ~Yep. Yep. See you. Ron's Lee.~"

    "transcript": "p1\n===\n\nRonsley: [00:00:00] Hello everyone. ~No, absolutely. Yeah, it was, it was, yeah. Yeah. I'd love~ today's topic is really on OpenAI's operator and deep research. ~And I've been doing some really cool testing and holy shit.~\n\n~So every time I come to these, I was like, I'm like, ~Oh, I'm going to show you something cool. Today is something like [00:00:10] ridiculously bonkers. ~So what I'd love is maybe what you know so far, if you've used it, does anyone have a chat GPT pro account? I think it is, is what you need to use. And has anyone heard of operator or deep research?~\n\n~If you could. Unmute yourself. I'd love to hear hear your voice. Give me some feedback before I just start jabbering away. I mean, we, we use the~ we have the teams account for the company. So everybody uses that, but I don't think it has deep research in the teams version. So I was looking at just upgrading to pro to play with it, but I I don't think [00:00:20] they've opened it up. \n\nThat feature to the teams yet. So so I don't know how that works between the two. I think we have to ~switch ~switch accounts or something like that in order to do the ~pro. I'm not sure. Yeah,~ I'd love to know what the teams look like. Because ~I was, I've been,~ [00:00:30] I was debating because ~we've got. We've got pro account.~\n\n~We've got like three pro accounts. Sorry.~ We've got three plus accounts of pro account. We've got Claude pro accounts. We've got a Gemini pro accounts. We've got perplexity pro accounts. And [00:00:40] I never really got into the teams cause I was wondering whether it was useful. How are you finding it? ~Cause we've just got multiple.~\n\n~Plus accounts rather than, you know, teams with, ~is that useful for, for team? It is because, well, a centralised billing is nice because what happened was [00:00:50] I'm still fighting because we had a bunch of plus accounts on people's credit cards and that we're still trying to get them all closed. And because they're all separate billing.\n\nSo we now with team, we could centralise the billing and then we could [00:01:00] just add out, we just add licenses, people, and then it just goes into one billing. So it's easy to manage that way. And you also could see if people are using it. ~You know, and then that kind of thing, ~but I think ~it's,~ it's basically the same as plus just in a team, but you also [00:01:10] can create your own GPTs and share them with each other really easily and stuff.\n\nSo it's got some other features that are nice. ~Yeah, got it. Got it. Thanks. Anyone else with any input on, on operator or deep research, have you heard of it? Do you know what we're talking about? Have you tried it~\n\n~team? I wasn't loved as a kid, so any interaction would be great.~\n\n~No, for me. No, okay, that's no for everyone. I've heard of it, but I haven't used it or tried it. I've heard about it and how it's supposed to work, but I haven't seen it or tried it myself. Okay. Okay, cool. Just so that I know where to begin, so let me just share my screen and. I am obviously in India right now.~\n\n~A lot of you who have attended the past sessions know that I'm here next week. I'll be in London and I think~ what's interesting ~with, with ~with chat GPT is that there's obviously [00:01:20] some features available only to us. So what I have done is right now I am connected to a VPN and it kind of thinks that I'm in the States.\n\nSo that's how. Operators [00:01:30] working for me. ~So if you get an account, if you're not in this,~ if you're not in the States and you're like, Oh, should I get a 200 account? Is it worth it? It's worth it. If you have a VPN because you can use [00:01:40] operator, but I think deep research for sure is available without the VPN.\n\n~So irrespective of where you're at, I think, sorry, not irrespective of where you're at. ~~I feel Europe still doesn't have it. I'll find out next week. Australia, Canada, U. S. Definitely has deep research.~~ But ~~today, we'll talk about two things. We'll talk about operator and we'll talk about deep research and, and I got to say, while operators cool, deep research will definitely make risk research assistance obsolate.~\n\n~And I'm not even, it's not even I'm not, it's not even. That's not even an over exaggeration.~~ ~~I feel that's like something that's going to happen really soon.~~ And I wrote a thesis. So I know what, what, what it goes into what goes into doing literature review or research before you write a thesis.~\n\n~So it's like. This just takes all that out of, out of the equation. ~So first this is the website that you go to, openai. com. Just look for operator ~is what you're looking for, but this is the, the, the website.~ And it'll show you, [00:01:50] basically tell you what operator is all about. And this is what has been making ~ ~the big headlines.\n\nOne thing to really know is that everyone's talking about agents. I saw someone, ~a really good friend of mine, by the way, yesterday~ on his [00:02:00] story say, Oh, we made three agents in 25 minutes. You are not making agents. You're making an AI that does a task. An agent [00:02:10] is hands off, independent, does its thing, comes back, it's like a team member that you can just tell, can you go and do this?\n\nAnd it does that. An agent is [00:02:20] not what people are calling. I think the marketing ploy right now is like everyone's calling these new names and people are buying stuff. So just be aware of that. The thing about Operator and [00:02:30] Operator did exist. ~ ~So Claude Anthropic actually released a version of this, ~ ~and I tested it.\n\nIt was great before, but it was very, very tech heavy, so it was not [00:02:40] easy to use. So instead of reading all this, and you can go and read all this if you want, but if you go to operator, chatgpt. com ~is the link for you to go to.~ And this is what it looks like. It looks very [00:02:50] similar, but it's an entirely different interface.\n\nIt's got none of the earlier things ~that ~that you have in ChatGPT, so it's got an entirely different interface. So in here you can do a bunch of different things, specifically like [00:03:00] dining, delivery, and very specific, obviously, to the U. S., because of delivery and other things, local services. Shopping, travel news, ~but I'll show you what I did.~\n\n~Actually, what we'll do is let's,~ let's do [00:03:10] something like\n\nI'm too scared to find out what the latest coming out of the White House right now is ~summarize, let's, let's, let's do that.~ Summarize the latest ~news latest~ in AI news. I'm going to give it context and say, ~these are my,~ this is my audience. Just a copy [00:03:20] paste of who I am. If you don't know about this, ~this is ~we did this ~in, in, in,~ in last month's training where we did IMX who helps Y achieve Zed. That's literally what that [00:03:30] is. And I'm unique because, so I help founders who build something amazing turn their genius into AI powered systems.\n\nPeople call me the amplifier because I take what makes you special and help [00:03:40] you scale it. We did something very similar. ~but ~it's basically that I'm giving it context and I'm saying, okay, we'll summarize the latest AI news, but this is who I help and this is who I am.\n\n[00:03:50] And if you look here, ~it's actually doing its thing. It's going, it's gone and found. ~It's gone and looked for news ~ ~and I'm my hands are here, obviously. So it's doing it's it's scrolling. It's using image recognition ~ ~to find [00:04:00] where it should click. It's reading. It's doing all this at the same time ~ ~while I'm so, you know, I don't have to do anything.\n\nSo, on the left hand side here, it [00:04:10] went, all right, the latest news ~from ~from the access highlights is that 3. Which actually is creating a lot of news around the world, ~primarily because. ~~ ~Primarily because again, we haven't tested it yet, [00:04:20] but they say that it's breaking ~all,~ all ELO scores and ELO is how you measure human intelligence. \n\n~So obviously it is, it is right, but ~I'll show you some other things we did at Operator. So I said that I'll be in London next week. [00:04:30] So I was like, well, ~I'm going to be,~ I'm going to be in Liverpool on the 6th of March. Can you find me two tickets to the game at Anfield? And then it did its thing.\n\n[00:04:40] So it kind of worked for 42 seconds and said, I checked the fixtures. There's actually no match on the sixth, but the closest ones on the eighth, would you like tickets to that? [00:04:50] And I said, yes. And then it did its thing. I'll show you what it did as well, because you can, ~you can I think, yeah, so you can, you can ~go back and see how ~it, it,~ it's operated.\n\nNow there are a few things to worry about here, [00:05:00] obviously that, you know, it has control over your browser. But it's very much in like a Faraday cage. In the sense that it only controls that part of the browser, but it went and [00:05:10] did that. And then it kind of went tickets are available with open. So it kind of told me when to register.\n\nGo here. And it did all that. And I didn't have to, like, go and search and find and do [00:05:20] do all that. The other thing I want to show you, which I thought was really cool.\n\n~Yeah, was so I just wanted to find out what was happening because the, the, the, the, the event I'm, I'm speaking at or booking my tickets and they were, they were talking about some they were talking about prices and stuff like that anyway.~ So I was like, Oh, let me do this research. ~ ~So I was very specific, by the way.\n\nI'm going from going to [00:05:30] Manchester. And ~I'm a,~ I'm a Qantas gold. ~ ~frequent flyer. So ~I was,~ I was like, Oh, I wonder whether that would change the input. And here's, what's really interesting. So it started to do its work. And then it got [00:05:40] to a point where it was like, I encountered a capture on the Skyscanner website, which is preventing me from continuing.\n\n~Can you take over? And~ so I took control ~ ~and then ~I and~ I went through this [00:05:50] capture and then gave control back ~ ~to operator. Okay, so that was really cool.~ I thought,~ I thought that they didn't stop and say, Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. It's done. Like, you know, I [00:06:00] got this problem. It kind of went, ~ ~you can you take over ~and, and, and,~ and then I'll take over from you.\n\nSo then ~ ~after it took over, it found Qatar Airways, ~which is.~ Which is like, there are lots of flights from here, by the way, but ~ ~[00:06:10] Qatar Airways allows me to use my Qantas code~ on,~ on the flight. So, ~I found that,~ I found that super interesting, ~and, and,~ and it [00:06:20] did that really well. ~So now, also, this is, I'm not in the States, so ~I would assume that someone in the States would find this even more useful because of the other things it can do.\n\nSo that's Operator. I think it's cool, I think Operator's cool. I don't think it's as [00:06:30] good as deep research and I wanted to show you this. ~ ~This is like a very famous ~ ~curve. It's called humanity's last exam and we're talking about ~when, when,~ [00:06:40] when do we get to humanity's last exam and you can see the curve here.\n\n~It's, it's, it's,~ it's really stupid that the curve and the quickness of how you're talking about April. 2024 to April [00:06:50] 2025. This is only a span of one year and this is how we went. We've even forgotten that 3 existed. This is [00:07:00] starting from 4 ~and ~and you can see how quickly this has taken off and now deep research is up here.\n\n~So this is literally ~[00:07:10] This is like, ~ ~I don't know. ~I'm,~ I'm blown away. I'm absolutely blown away ~by, by,~ by that. So I'll show you what to do. Go to chat. openai. com or chat. com. We'll take you to [00:07:20] your, ~ ~to your chat GPT and then I am a pro. So I suppose this deep research will come up in here. ~ Now I want to show you a couple of things before I go and do Actually, what am I do instead of instead of that?~\n\n~Maybe we can use someone as an example that's in here So i'm going to just stop that. So can I get any can I get you someone as a hot seat if you don't mind? So what I want need from you is this is who I am. This is who I help This is the outcome I deliver and this is why I'm unique. So if you can give me that, I would love to use you as a hot seat and, and use operator and do some research market research on you.~\n\n~If that's cool. Anyone, anyone up for that? ~\n\n~Come on, boys. Awesome. Nobby, can you put that in the chat if you don't mind? I help X who does Y achieve Zed, and I'm unique because ABC. ~\n\n~So while Nobby's doing that, I'm going to share my screen again, and I'm going to show you some cool stuff.~ Is deep search [00:07:30] or deep research part of Plus? Or is it part of operator? ~ ~It's not part of plus it's part of pro ~ ~and there's a very good reason. It's part of pro. ~Like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. 200 a month.~\n\n~Correct. Yeah, I, I very~ I was very [00:07:40] hesitant to upgrade to pro. And the reason why is you heard this because you were there from the start. I've got so many accounts. I've got so many plus accounts. I got Claude pro accounts. I've [00:07:50] got all these accounts of like, ah, do I need the pro, but as a test to do this webinar and another couple of ones that I'm doing for [00:08:00] Dubai.\n\nI was like, ~ ~I should know what's going on and ~I should,~ I should test it. ~ ~So ~I, I, I just, I ~was like, let me upgrade, let me test it. It didn't even take me five minutes for me to go, Oh, that's why it's 200 [00:08:10] bucks. I was like, Oh shit, that's crazy.~ So let me not be here. Okay. Amazing. But before I, before I get.~\n\n~Anyone else with a question? Yeah, ~in my plus account. It says in deep search. That'll be different than deep research. ~ ~Correct? ~ ~And I'll show you [00:08:20] why. ~So in here.~ So this is 1 that I ran yesterday ~ ~~ ~~ ~~and it was very like, in the sense.~ Now, a lot of people were saying how prompting is going to die, and I don't think that's the case, ~at least,~ at least for the near future, primarily because [00:08:30] it's so important to prompt correctly,~ to know how to get~~ now,~ especially with deep research, because you only get~ as you~~ only get~ a certain amount to do in a month, you can't like just go ham on it ~and,~ and decide to just Go [00:08:40] crazy.\n\nEven though it's 200, there's a certain limit that you can do. I'm not really sure. I think it'll be in that article that I started off with. ~ ~So, you have to be very specific ~and,~ and [00:08:50] because it goes and does all the thinking and ~it's, this is,~ this is very agent like. By the way, again, we're still not at agents yet, I don't think, because there's a [00:09:00] certain way to define an agent.\n\nBut this is very agentic like in the way it works. So, if you don't give it the right instructions to start off with, it goes off in a whole [00:09:10] different direction, and you don't want that to happen. So ~I was,~ I kind of went, well I just wanted to find me a hundred ways to improve and grow a video podcast, do this specifically for [00:09:20] my audience, and I just kind of put who my audience is.\n\n~ ~Now the reason I wanted to do that is because I've been putting out a lot of content on AI, and I think people have forgotten [00:09:30] that I still do podcasts. So I was like, maybe I want to, I want to revitalize that because I think they both go hand in hand. with [00:09:40] authenticity and amplification and business growth.\n\nSo I was like, I want to first create this article.~ Okay. ~So then it went, okay. Yeah. Before I go out and head in a direction, can you [00:09:50] please clarify these few things? So what's your podcast? You know, core theme. Who's it for? What's the stage? So when, assume this is for any business that has a podcast [00:10:00] for branding, growth, whatever.\n\nAnd I've given it context. Then it went away ~ ~and did research. And I want to show you the research here on ~the left hand side, on~ the right hand side because [00:10:10] That is crazy. So it went and started to work on it. And then it searched for strategies for video podcast growth. It started to compile ~it.~ It was like, Oh, I don't [00:10:20] think it,~ I don't think~ I have enough yet.\n\nIt's searched for more strategies, plotted to piece it together. Then it found these different areas based on its initial research. And then [00:10:30] it went, okay, now I'm going to find stuff from each of these areas. Then I'm going to find stuff about YouTube podcasts. I didn't do any of this stuff. I let it be, and it just did [00:10:40] all this for itself.\n\nAnd I'm going to show you how that works ~with Nobby's example. ~It went and gathered all the details. ~ ~There's a whole bunch of things. I'm talking about five minutes of work, found 13 resources, and then [00:10:50] it made this. A hundred strategies to grow your business video podcast and literally a hundred ~and it,~ and it organized it pre launch with [00:11:00] sources.\n\nSo you can literally go here and go, okay, this is the source, this is more details. ~ And it's like, it's, it's,~ it's absolutely insane because not only did it do all that, it [00:11:10] followed my custom instructions that was inside my custom instructions on how to write. And how to present all this. ~ ~And that is a crazy article for five minutes.[00:11:20] \n\nCan you imagine getting someone to write this for you with all those links? Can you just think about that? ~ ~That is crazy, ~ right? ~That's absolutely blew my mind. So [00:11:30] then I was like, Oh, that's interesting. ~ ~I wonder if I give it more direction, whether it'll be even better. I don't know. Holy shit. So [00:11:40] I gave it a similar instruction, but I was like, wait, can you please?\n\nDo this specifically from wearepodcast. com. I've released over 350 [00:11:50] episodes. This is where you find it. It can be found on all Apple podcasts or Spotify. I'm sure you can find a hundred ways to grow a podcast only from these episodes. Please be [00:12:00] specific. And then I gave it similar instructions of who my audience is.\n\nAgain, it asked me for clarification. ~ ~And then it went ahead. And this time it worked for 15 [00:12:10] minutes. And found 49 sources. And they were all from my podcast. ~ ~All from my podcast. So now ~ ~this is an [00:12:20] article that links to all the different parts of my podcast that I've already spoken about how to grow a podcast.\n\nThat's crazy. That is hands off. I [00:12:30] didn't need anyone. ~Now the biggest,~ the biggest gap here for me right now. Is I had given all my stuff away to my team, so I don't even have logins to my website [00:12:40] and ~I'm asking yesterday.~ I sent a message on the team ~on the thing.~ I was like, can I have my logins back?\n\nBecause I want to post this. And that's the block. Like, ~can you, that's a, that's crazy. The block was never posting.~ The block was always, ah, it takes so much time to create. That's not a thing [00:12:50] anymore. And this is so amazing. This is absolutely mind blowing. ~So let's do one of these~~ for, for Nobby. So, Nobby, I'd love for you to, Unmute yourself and I'm going to copy and paste.~\n\n~So let's, let me ask you,~ so if you help people manage their money, ~ ~who are these people? So predominantly the [00:13:00] people I'm looking for are more the affluent CEO white collar. People who've got a higher income and can afford to pay the premium for the program. ~Yeah, but this would help.~ So, for example, if you were to create, let's just [00:13:10] assume~ you're, you're, you're,~ you're writing for an audience and if they can afford you, they, ~ ~They get into the program.\n\nIf they can't afford you, they can read the thing [00:13:20] and get value out of it. ~What does that look?~ What does that thing look like? Well, actually, I have another program, which is a step down. It's the core functionality of the main program that they can go and [00:13:30] buy, which is on the cheaper end of the scale. So, and the difference that we're talking about is like 300 bucks compared to 3000 bucks. \n\nSo the ones who can afford to pay the ~three, three,~ three and a half thousand, and the ones who [00:13:40] can't afford it can get the core functionality for 300. ~ ~~What about~~, ~what about if they, ~they ~can't afford it? ~ What, what can they, so for example,~ what I mean by that, okay, is you're talking about the CEOs who have disposable money and then maybe [00:13:50] someone below who has a bit more disposable money, but what if someone's starting out to get to a point to get disposable money to afford you?\n\n~Can you,~ what could you [00:14:00] create for them ~ to, do you see what I'm trying to say? Okay,~ so the place that I start with them is I give them a free report. So whenever you're going to do anything financial, you've got to hand over your, your financial details of [00:14:10] income and expenses and debts. So I get people to put that into a form.\n\nIt prints out a free report. It says, this is where you are. This is where you could be. [00:14:20] And that basically then ~tells me,~ tells that person, do I want to be in or do I not want to be in? For the ones who therefore don't go to the next step, it's [00:14:30] basically, well, I can see that I can be better off. What do I need to do?\n\nI don't actually give them anything. It's just a general stuff. Spend less than you earn and pay the highest interest at first. You [00:14:40] can't do more than that. ~ ~So you, you said here, ~what makes,~ what makes my program unique is that it was created for women because of women. Did you not complete that or? [00:14:50] No, that, that was basically where the idea came from originally because I was always being asked by women they'd say, I don't want to know about financial planning or insurance or investment.\n\nI want to know how do I manage my daily [00:15:00] money because they were running out of money before running out a month. Cost of living was going up, but incomes were remaining stagnant. And so they were being expected to do more at [00:15:10] home with less money. And you know, that's. In most families that just leads to stress, etc.\n\nSo they were asking that question, how can I do more to manage my money and the simple answer was spend less than you're going to [00:15:20] pay the highest interest at first. ~ ~\n\nSo, I mean, it's not rocket science. That information's been around for a long time. In essence, what I've built is the better mousetrap. ~ ~So, a budget is the basic mousetrap. [00:15:30] And what I've created is the better mousetrap. ~ ~Because if budgets work, there'd be ~no,~ no reason for a better mousetrap. ~I would encourage you to change your languaging around your audience.~\n\n~Because I would say that that comes through in how you market. Like mousetrap, you know So, think of them as Think of, of, of you being a guide to helping them along the way, rather than trapping them into, you know, just, just something that I noticed in your language. That's, that's all. I don't use that conversation.~\n\n~It's only here that I've ever basically said that. Yeah, yeah. So I don't say this sort of thing in front of customers, making them feel as though they've been trapped or something. Yeah. Help them manage their money.~ So this is something simple, right? ~Can you create, so the reason,~ so you're talking about master, maybe ~I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll talk it, I'll,~ I'll [00:15:40] refer to it as ~ ~on your website.\n\nIf you had like this one solid article that linked to all these other places, then they. ~You know,~ accepted your links. And then this [00:15:50] article grew in. So when you search for 50 tips for women to manage their money, ~who before the, you know, that kind of stuff, so for you to write an article like that.~\n\n~It would have taken me a long time, it would, you know, uh, Oh, I didn't see. So I did that without deep research. ~"

    "transcript": "AAI127\n===\n\nRonsley: ~ Good morning for you, bright and early. Happy. Good morning. Good evening for me. But you have a training session next week that you're advertising. Is that the same one that we did with? It's a different one. Yeah. It's the one that it's the one that the James asked, like, he was like, Oh, is there a way that.~\n\n~We could get AI to write like us and do the content. So that's the whole, it's the whole content workshop. Okay. Is that something that's out of this academy? So it's something we need to pay for, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's not in the academy and the academy is sorry, this is a fucking mosquito driving me crazy.~\n\n~The academy is separate. It's like 17 a month, something really cheap, I think, but if you're already in it and you got it in free, then you won the early ones. And yeah, so that's kind of separate. It's more support and community and yeah, the, the, the monthly, the monthly webinars are just like this add on that no discount code, right?~\n\n~Say again. Is there a discount code? Just if you send an email through Nat has like has a breakdown of if you've attended before you get a, you get, you get some sort of thing. I can't remember what it is. So if you just send an email, Nat would reply back to you with and say, I attended the last, the last one.~\n\n~Okay. All right. Thank you. I think it's next week, Thursday, right? It is exactly Thursday. Yep. You're right. Thank you. You're very welcome. Scott's mental Mercedes would love to see or hear you. If you're around Scott, welcome. Hey, Mercedes, how are you Scott? How's it going? Good. How are you? Fantastic.~\n\n~Good to see you. Good to see you too. I think we met years ago, actually in at two 12. I 2 12. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That was a long time ago. Yeah. Like five years ago. Yeah. I think it was, we got, we got into Santa Barbara for that one. Or is it or is it probably Santa Barbara? Yeah. Santa Barbara. Yeah. I think that's, I remember, I remember meeting there.~\n\n~So, yeah. Oh, cool. And it's been, I think COVID has just knocked my concept of time and space out. So like, yeah, the five years seem like such a long time ago. It does. Yeah, I was thinking like they, because they had that 2020 event they were going to do and then it ended up getting canceled because of coded.~\n\n~Right? And then how many, how many did you go to? Did you just go to the last 1? Or did you go to the other ones to just the 1? Yeah, just the 1. Okay. I'm a, I'm an. Members have been going to mastermind talks for maybe. Since 2018, so that's that's another similar, but more close knit community. It's actually happening right now in Delmar, but it was like 4 flights or something from here.~\n\n~So I was like, no, it's too far. Okay. Yeah, I think, I'm kind of friends like Dan Martell's in that too, right? For a long time. Yeah, as well. Okay. Martell's in there Martell's in there Tim Ferriss is in there Ryan Holliday's in there. There's some pretty cool people. Like it's, it's not, the first time I went in 2013, in 2018, I went to Fox City.~\n\n~I was like, I don't know if I belong in the right room because on my table was Dave Asprey and like, I was like, what, how did I get in here? Oh, yeah, no doubt. I mean, yeah, cause MMT is Dave Asprey. I've met him a few times at his conference and stuff. But yeah, I mean, 212 was like that for me too. It was like, cause the first, I would, I went every year and Tim, Tim Ferris was the first year.~\n\n~It was like Ryan Holiday. I mean, all these people, I just thought I was in the wrong room and they kept inviting me back every year. So I was grateful, but I didn't, I didn't feel like I deserved it. So, man, we all go, we all go through the same thing. I went to something similar. Yeah, it's it's, Don't feel, don't feel different.~\n\n~I mean, don't feel like, you know I, I, I think most people in go through that. I definitely went through that for sure. Well, good to have you here. Hello everyone. No, absolutely. Yeah, it was, it was, yeah. Yeah. I'd love today's topic is really on OpenAI's operator and deep research. And I've been doing some really cool testing and holy shit.~\n\n~So every time I come to these, I was like, I'm like, Oh, I'm going to show you something cool. Today is something like ridiculously bonkers. So what I'd love is maybe what you know so far, if you've used it, does anyone have a chat GPT pro account? I think it is, is what you need to use. And has anyone heard of operator or deep research?~\n\n~If you could. Unmute yourself. I'd love to hear hear your voice. Give me some feedback before I just start jabbering away. I mean, we, we use the we have the teams account for the company. So everybody uses that, but I don't think it has deep research in the teams version. So I was looking at just upgrading to pro to play with it, but I I don't think they've opened it up. ~\n\n~That feature to the teams yet. So so I don't know how that works between the two. I think we have to switch switch accounts or something like that in order to do the pro. I'm not sure. Yeah, I'd love to know what the teams look like. Because I was, I've been, I was debating because we've got. We've got pro account.~\n\n~We've got like three pro accounts. Sorry. We've got three plus accounts of pro account. We've got Claude pro accounts. We've got a Gemini pro accounts. We've got perplexity pro accounts. And I never really got into the teams cause I was wondering whether it was useful. How are you finding it? Cause we've just got multiple.~\n\n~Plus accounts rather than, you know, teams with, is that useful for, for team? It is because, well, a centralised billing is nice because what happened was I'm still fighting because we had a bunch of plus accounts on people's credit cards and that we're still trying to get them all closed. And because they're all separate billing.~\n\n~So we now with team, we could centralise the billing and then we could just add out, we just add licenses, people, and then it just goes into one billing. So it's easy to manage that way. And you also could see if people are using it. You know, and then that kind of thing, but I think it's, it's basically the same as plus just in a team, but you also can create your own GPTs and share them with each other really easily and stuff.~\n\n~So it's got some other features that are nice. Yeah, got it. Got it. Thanks. Anyone else with any input on, on operator or deep research, have you heard of it? Do you know what we're talking about? Have you tried it~\n\n~team? I wasn't loved as a kid, so any interaction would be great.~\n\n~No, for me. No, okay, that's no for everyone. I've heard of it, but I haven't used it or tried it. I've heard about it and how it's supposed to work, but I haven't seen it or tried it myself. Okay. Okay, cool. Just so that I know where to begin, so let me just share my screen and. I am obviously in India right now.~\n\n~A lot of you who have attended the past sessions know that I'm here next week. I'll be in London and I think what's interesting with, with with chat GPT is that there's obviously some features available only to us. So what I have done is right now I am connected to a VPN and it kind of thinks that I'm in the States.~\n\n~So that's how. Operators working for me. So if you get an account, if you're not in this, if you're not in the States and you're like, Oh, should I get a 200 account? Is it worth it? It's worth it. If you have a VPN because you can use operator, but I think deep research for sure is available without the VPN.~\n\n~So irrespective of where you're at, I think, sorry, not irrespective of where you're at. ~~I feel Europe still doesn't have it. I'll find out next week. Australia, Canada, U. S. Definitely has deep research.~~ But ~~today, we'll talk about two things. We'll talk about operator and we'll talk about deep research and, and I got to say, while operators cool, deep research will definitely make risk research assistance obsolate.~\n\n~And I'm not even, it's not even I'm not, it's not even. That's not even an over exaggeration.~~ ~~I feel that's like something that's going to happen really soon.~~ And I wrote a thesis. So I know what, what, what it goes into what goes into doing literature review or research before you write a thesis.~\n\n~So it's like. This just takes all that out of, out of the equation. So first this is the website that you go to, openai. com. Just look for operator is what you're looking for, but this is the, the, the website. And it'll show you, basically tell you what operator is all about. And this is what has been making the big headlines.~\n\n~One thing to really know is that everyone's talking about agents.~~ I saw someone, a really good friend of mine, by the way, yesterday on his story say, Oh, we made three agents in 25 minutes. You are not making agents. You're making an AI that does a task. An agent is hands off, independent, does its thing, comes back, it's like a team member that you can just tell, can you go and do this?~\n\n~And it does that~~. An agent is not what people are calling. I think the marketing ploy right now is like everyone's calling these new names and people are buying stuff. So just ~~be aware of that~~. The thing about Operator and Operator did exist. So Claude Anthropic actually released a version of this, and I tested it.~\n\n~It was great before, but it was very, very tech heavy, so it was not easy to use. So instead of reading all this, and you can go and read all this if you want, but if you go to operator, chatgpt. com is the link for you to go to. And this is what it looks like. It looks very similar, but it's an entirely different interface.~\n\n~It's got none of the earlier things that that you have in ChatGPT, so it's got an entirely different interface. So in here you can do a bunch of different things, specifically like dining, delivery, and very specific, obviously, to the U. S., because of delivery and other things, local services. Shopping, travel news, but I'll show you what I did.~\n\n~Actually, what we'll do is let's, let's do something like~\n\n~I'm too scared to find out what the latest coming out of the White House right now is summarize, let's, let's, let's do that. Summarize the latest news latest in AI news. I'm going to give it context and say, these are my, this is my audience. Just a copy paste of who I am. If you don't know about this, this is we did this in, in, in, in last month's training where we did IMX who helps Y achieve Zed. That's literally what that is. And I'm unique because, so I help founders who build something amazing turn their genius into AI powered systems.~\n\n~People call me the amplifier because I take what makes you special and help you scale it. We did something very similar. but it's basically that I'm giving it context and I'm saying, okay, we'll summarize the latest AI news, but this is who I help and this is who I am.~\n\n~And if you look here, it's actually doing its thing. It's going, it's gone and found. It's gone and looked for news and I'm my hands are here, obviously. So it's doing it's it's scrolling. It's using image recognition to find where it should click. It's reading. It's doing all this at the same time while I'm so, you know, I don't have to do anything.~\n\n~So, on the left hand side here, it went, all right, the latest news from from the access highlights is that 3. Which actually is creating a lot of news around the world, primarily because. Primarily because again, we haven't tested it yet, but they say that it's breaking all, all ELO scores and ELO is how you measure human intelligence. ~\n\n~So obviously it is, it is right, but I'll show you some other things we did at Operator. So I said that I'll be in London next week. So I was like, well, I'm going to be, I'm going to be in Liverpool on the 6th of March. Can you find me two tickets to the game at Anfield? And then it did its thing.~\n\n~So it kind of worked for 42 seconds and said, I checked the fixtures. There's actually no match on the sixth, but the closest ones on the eighth, would you like tickets to that? And I said, yes. And then it did its thing. I'll show you what it did as well, because you can, you can I think, yeah, so you can, you can go back and see how it, it, it's operated.~\n\n~Now there are a few things to worry about here, obviously that, you know, it has control over your browser. But it's very much in like a Faraday cage. In the sense that it only controls that part of the browser, but it went and did that. And then it kind of went tickets are available with open. So it kind of told me when to register.~\n\n~Go here. And it did all that. And I didn't have to, like, go and search and find and do do all that. The other thing I want to show you, which I thought was really cool.~\n\n~Yeah, was so I just wanted to find out what was happening because the, the, the, the, the event I'm, I'm speaking at or booking my tickets and they were, they were talking about some they were talking about prices and stuff like that anyway. So I was like, Oh, let me do this research. So I was very specific, by the way.~\n\n~I'm going from going to Manchester. And I'm a, I'm a Qantas gold. frequent flyer. So I was, I was like, Oh, I wonder whether that would change the input. And here's, what's really interesting. So it started to do its work. And then it got to a point where it was like, I encountered a capture on the Skyscanner website, which is preventing me from continuing.~\n\n~Can you take over? And so I took control and then I and I went through this capture and then gave control back to operator. Okay, so that was really cool. I thought, I thought that they didn't stop and say, Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. It's done. Like, you know, I got this problem. It kind of went, you can you take over and, and, and, and then I'll take over from you.~\n\n~So then after it took over, it found Qatar Airways, which is. Which is like, there are lots of flights from here, by the way, but Qatar Airways allows me to use my Qantas code on, on the flight. So, I found that, I found that super interesting, and, and, and it did that really well. So now, also, this is, I'm not in the States, so I would assume that someone in the States would find this even more useful because of the other things it can do.~\n\n~So that's Operator. I think it's cool, I think Operator's cool. I don't think it's as good as deep research and I wanted to show you this. This is like a very famous curve. It's called humanity's last exam and we're talking about when, when, when do we get to humanity's last exam and you can see the curve here.~\n\n~It's, it's, it's, it's really stupid that the curve and the quickness of how you're talking about April. 2024 to April 2025. This is only a span of one year and this is how we went. We've even forgotten that 3 existed. This is starting from 4 and and you can see how quickly this has taken off and now deep research is up here.~\n\n~So this is literally This is like, I don't know. I'm, I'm blown away. I'm absolutely blown away by, by, by that. So I'll show you what to do. Go to chat. openai. com or chat. com. We'll take you to your, to your chat GPT and then I am a pro. So I suppose this deep research will come up in here. Now I want to show you a couple of things before I go and do Actually, what am I do instead of instead of that?~\n\n~Maybe we can use someone as an example that's in here So i'm going to just stop that. So can I get any can I get you someone as a hot seat if you don't mind? So what I want need from you is this is who I am. This is who I help This is the outcome I deliver and this is why I'm unique. So if you can give me that, I would love to use you as a hot seat and, and use operator and do some research market research on you.~\n\n~If that's cool. Anyone, anyone up for that? ~\n\n~Come on, boys. Awesome. Nobby, can you put that in the chat if you don't mind? I help X who does Y achieve Zed, and I'm unique because ABC. ~\n\n~So while Nobby's doing that, I'm going to share my screen again, and I'm going to show you some cool stuff. Is deep search or deep research part of Plus? Or is it part of operator? It's not part of plus it's part of pro and there's a very good reason. It's part of pro. Like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. 200 a month.~\n\n~Correct. Yeah, I, I very I was very hesitant to upgrade to pro. And the reason why is you heard this because you were there from the start. I've got so many accounts. I've got so many plus accounts. I got Claude pro accounts. I've got all these accounts of like, ah, do I need the pro, but as a test to do this webinar and another couple of ones that I'm doing for Dubai.~\n\n~I was like, I should know what's going on and I should, I should test it. So I, I, I just, I was like, let me upgrade, let me test it. It didn't even take me five minutes for me to go, Oh, that's why it's 200 bucks. I was like, Oh shit, that's crazy. So let me not be here. Okay. Amazing. But before I, before I get.~\n\n~Anyone else with a question? Yeah, in my plus account. It says in deep search. That'll be different than deep research. Correct? And I'll show you why. So in here. So this is 1 that I ran yesterday and it was very like, in the sense. ~~Now, a lot of people were saying how prompting is going to die,~~ and I don't think that's the case, at least, at least for the near future, primarily because ~~it's so important to prompt correctly, to know how to get~~ now, especially with deep research, because you only get as you only get a certain amount to do in a month, you can't like just go ham on it and, and decide to just Go crazy.~\n\n~Even though it's 200, there's a certain limit that you can do. I'm not really sure. I think it'll be in that article that I started off with. So, you have to be very specific and, and because it goes and does all the thinking and it's, this is, this is very agent like. By the way, again, we're still not at agents yet, I don't think, because there's a certain way to define an agent.~\n\n~But this is very agentic like in the way it works. So,~~ if you don't give it the right instructions to start off with, it goes off in a whole different direction~~, and you don't want that to happen. So I was, I kind of went, well I just wanted to find me a hundred ways to improve and grow a video podcast, do this specifically for my audience, and I just kind of put who my audience is.~\n\n~ Now the reason I wanted to do that is because I've been putting out a lot of content on AI, and I think people have forgotten that I still do podcasts. So I was like, maybe I want to, I want to revitalize that because I think they both go hand in hand. with authenticity and amplification and business growth.~\n\n~So I was like, I want to first create this article. Okay. So then it went, okay. Yeah. Before I go out and head in a direction, can you please clarify these few things? So what's your podcast? You know, core theme. Who's it for? What's the stage? So when, assume this is for any business that has a podcast for branding, growth, whatever.~\n\n~And I've given it context. Then it went away and did research. And I want to show you the research here on the left hand side, on the right hand side because That is crazy. So it went and started to work on it. And then it searched for strategies for video podcast growth. It started to compile it. It was like, Oh, I don't think it, I don't think I have enough yet.~\n\n~It's searched for more strategies, plotted to piece it together. Then it found these different areas based on its initial research. And then it went, okay, now I'm going to find stuff from each of these areas. Then I'm going to find stuff about YouTube podcasts. I didn't do any of this stuff. I let it be, and it just did all this for itself.~\n\n~And I'm going to show you how that works with Nobby's example. It went and gathered all the details. There's a whole bunch of things. I'm talking about five minutes of work, found 13 resources, and then it made this. A hundred strategies to grow your business video podcast and literally a hundred and it, and it organized it pre launch with sources.~\n\n~So you can literally go here and go, okay, this is the source, this is more details. And it's like, it's, it's, it's absolutely insane because not only did it do all that, it followed my custom instructions that was inside my custom instructions on how to write. And how to present all this. And that is a crazy article for five minutes.~\n\n~Can you imagine getting someone to write this for you with all those links? Can you just think about that? That is crazy, right? That's absolutely blew my mind. So then I was like, Oh, that's interesting. I wonder if I give it more direction, whether it'll be even better. I don't know. Holy shit. So I gave it a similar instruction, but I was like, wait, can you please?~\n\n~Do this specifically from wearepodcast. com. I've released over 350 episodes. This is where you find it. It can be found on all Apple podcasts or Spotify. I'm sure you can find a hundred ways to grow a podcast only from these episodes. Please be specific. And then I gave it similar instructions of who my audience is.~\n\n~Again, it asked me for clarification. And then it went ahead. And this time it worked for 15 minutes. And found 49 sources. And they were all from my podcast. All from my podcast. So now this is an article that links to all the different parts of my podcast that I've already spoken about how to grow a podcast.~\n\n~That's crazy. That is hands off. I didn't need anyone. Now the biggest, the biggest gap here for me right now. Is I had given all my stuff away to my team, so I don't even have logins to my website and I'm asking yesterday. I sent a message on the team on the thing. I was like, can I have my logins back?~\n\n~Because I want to post this. And that's the block. Like, can you, that's a, that's crazy. The block was never posting. The block was always, ah, it takes so much time to create. That's not a thing anymore. And this is so amazing. This is absolutely mind blowing. So let's do one of these for, for Nobby. So, Nobby, I'd love for you to, Unmute yourself and I'm going to copy and paste.~\n\n~So let's, let me ask you, so if you help people manage their money, who are these people? So predominantly the people I'm looking for are more the affluent CEO white collar. People who've got a higher income and can afford to pay the premium for the program. Yeah, but this would help. So, for example, if you were to create, let's just assume you're, you're, you're, you're writing for an audience and if they can afford you, they, They get into the program.~\n\n~If they can't afford you, they can read the thing and get value out of it. What does that look? What does that thing look like? Well, actually, I have another program, which is a step down. It's the core functionality of the main program that they can go and buy, which is on the cheaper end of the scale. So, and the difference that we're talking about is like 300 bucks compared to 3000 bucks. ~\n\n~So the ones who can afford to pay the three, three, three and a half thousand, and the ones who can't afford it can get the core functionality for 300. What about, what about if they, they can't afford it? What, what can they, so for example, what I mean by that, okay, is you're talking about the CEOs who have disposable money and then maybe someone below who has a bit more disposable money, but what if someone's starting out to get to a point to get disposable money to afford you?~\n\n~Can you, what could you create for them to, do you see what I'm trying to say? Okay, so the place that I start with them is I give them a free report. So whenever you're going to do anything financial, you've got to hand over your, your financial details of income and expenses and debts. So I get people to put that into a form.~\n\n~It prints out a free report. It says, this is where you are. This is where you could be. And that basically then tells me, tells that person, do I want to be in or do I not want to be in? For the ones who therefore don't go to the next step, it's basically, well, I can see that I can be better off. What do I need to do?~\n\n~I don't actually give them anything. It's just a general stuff. Spend less than you earn and pay the highest interest at first. You can't do more than that. So you, you said here, what makes, what makes my program unique is that it was created for women because of women. Did you not complete that or? No, that, that was basically where the idea came from originally because I was always being asked by women they'd say, I don't want to know about financial planning or insurance or investment.~\n\n~I want to know how do I manage my daily money because they were running out of money before running out a month. Cost of living was going up, but incomes were remaining stagnant. And so they were being expected to do more at home with less money. And you know, that's. In most families that just leads to stress, etc.~\n\n~So they were asking that question, how can I do more to manage my money and the simple answer was spend less than you're going to pay the highest interest at first. ~\n\n~So, I mean, it's not rocket science. That information's been around for a long time. In essence, what I've built is the better mousetrap. So, a budget is the basic mousetrap. And what I've created is the better mousetrap. Because if budgets work, there'd be no, no reason for a better mousetrap. I would encourage you to change your languaging around your audience.~\n\n~Because I would say that that comes through in how you market. Like mousetrap, you know So, think of them as Think of, of, of you being a guide to helping them along the way, rather than trapping them into, you know, just, just something that I noticed in your language. That's, that's all. I don't use that conversation.~\n\n~It's only here that I've ever basically said that. Yeah, yeah. So I don't say this sort of thing in front of customers, making them feel as though they've been trapped or something. Yeah. Help them manage their money. So this is something simple, right? Can you create, so the reason, so you're talking about master, maybe I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll talk it, I'll, I'll refer to it as on your website.~\n\n~If you had like this one solid article that linked to all these other places, then they. You know, accepted your links. And then this article grew in. So when you search for 50 tips for women to manage their money, who before the, you know, that kind of stuff, so for you to write an article like that.~\n\n~It would have taken me a long, long time, it would, you know, uh, Oh, I didn't see. So I did that without deep research.~ [00:00:00] So this is what happened. I didn't click the deep research button and it gave me 50 tips. Great. Let's do that ~ ~with deep [00:00:10] research. ~I ~\n\n~mean, I'm playing around with AI every day and I'm, I'm putting articles out on LinkedIn and, and Facebook and everything. Can you answer these questions for me, Nobby? ~What's the tone you prefer? Conversational. \n\nThen what would you like the tips, would you like them categorized? Not as budgeting. What I do in [00:00:20] AI is I tell it to make it inspirational, aspirational, and transformational. \n\n~Ah, so categorize them as, say again, inspirational? Inspirational aspirational, and transformational. ~So in other words, we're taking them from where they are, which is a bad spot, to somewhere better. Do you want any [00:00:30] references to statistics or studies to add credibility? Yes, I'll say yes. Should the focus be on quick wins or a mix quick wins?[00:00:40] \n\nQuick wins, but I also concentrate not, and that's where budgets fail. My program actually goes through to age 100, so it actually shows them the future [00:00:50] rather than restricting them to the money in, money out, that's all I've got left, life is over. ~ ~That's that's great. The specific is for you and your people.\n\nI'm [00:01:00] showing you how if you want to create something useful for your people, this is the way you would do that. And this is for anyone ~in here. So I'm just using you as an example.~ So what happens right now is we kind of went, ~ ~this [00:01:10] is who I am. This is what my audience is, is how I'm different. What I want to create is something that I can keep pointing people to, and I think we should all have that.\n\n~Not, not as a, not as a~ not as a way to capture [00:01:20] people, but it should capture people 100%. There should be maybe a an email lead capture in there ~ ~for sure, but it should be more to help them [00:01:30] along their way. So maybe in 90 days and 60 days in a year, in two years, they become a client. So what it's done is, ~ ~If you see on the right hand side, ~it's ~it's thinking, right?\n\nSo [00:01:40] it's doing it's first arranging the articles into three sections. It is outlining ~ ~the high impact actions like salary negotiation. Is [00:01:50] getting data on women's financial confidence. See, that's fascinating for me because, so this is very agent like behavior. ~Still not,~ still not an [00:02:00] agent yet. But agent like behavior.\n\nSo I want you to understand the difference. Then it searched for women financial confidence statistics. It found that that's [00:02:10] crazy which I didn't know myself. And, and so this is what ~this this~ is doing is it's fine. Even for someone who knew things about podcasting, for example, when you saw [00:02:20] my example. There were things in there that it would take me a long time to get to because I'm so in my thing, you know So then [00:02:30] here I'm noticing that less than half of women over 25 have retirement savings compared to men's median savings.\n\nAdditionally, 67 percent of women fear outliving their savings, [00:02:40] a pressing concern given their longer life expectancy. That's crazy. So just think about the thinking here, right? This is why. The [00:02:50] 200 makes so much sense because it's taken over thinking~ Scott, I mean, I'm aware of all that stuff. Great for you.~\n\n~You're not the person this is for. This is for your people. Yeah, yeah. So ~it's done all that. Again, you might know all that, but for you to [00:03:00] put this in an article, in the time that it's doing it right now, in the way it's doing it, ~is, is,~ is not possible. It's not humanly possible to do that. ~So No, but I've touched on all of those things in the past in articles.~\n\n~Good for you, Nobby. And I don't mean to sound like a smart ass,~\n\n~I just know my stuff. ~So, I would assume that is [00:03:10] basic, that anyone who has a business knows their stuff. I think that's I feel that's a that's like a restaurant saying I serve good food. [00:03:20] You're supposed to it's ~ ~It's like a, you know, a given. So I wonder whether ~you're, you know,~ if we gave it for women in a particular age group, whether that would even change the [00:03:30] report even more. \n\nSo the target audience originally, the avatar was a 47 year old woman recently divorced. With two teenage children looking back on the past, having nothing, [00:03:40] looking forward to the future for the next 20 years, how am I going to cope? What am I going to retire on? I've got nothing to start with. And that's basically a situation for probably [00:03:50] around about 50 percent of women going forward. \n\nAnd my advice to them all is buy yourself a camper van so you have somewhere to sleep.\n\nso it depends on where you're in the world, obviously, and it depends on how much ~you've You've~ [00:04:00] where you've lived. But in Australia, it like living is it's ridiculously easy coming from a place like India. Because, ~you know, I went when I was ~I got to [00:04:10] Australia when I was what, 21 ~ ~and everything was just so easy.\n\nyou see the difference is a huge difference, obviously, in what lifestyle looks like. And also in terms of support, like the Australian [00:04:20] government, Is ~ ~compared to a lot of other governments, extremely supportive. ~So yeah, I,~ and I see a financial advisor for two and a half years.\n\nSo I used to go into homes and meet people who [00:04:30] literally would put all their savings into something and lose it all. And it was just like heartbreaking. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. I did it for like two years and I was [00:04:40] like, ~ ~I can't do this. It's too, it's heartbreaking. ~ ~I did it for 20 years.\n\nAnd I love what I was doing because I was helping protect families and helping them for their futures, which is [00:04:50] all well and good. I mean, I'm, you know, I'm not ranting on about financial planners, but at the end of the day in today's economy, women find it very difficult to find a place once a [00:05:00] relationship breaks down, especially if they've got kids trying to find a home. \n\nMaybe not where you are, but in the main cities, ~it's ~it's a big deal. So ~there's a lot of I was going to say influence.~ There's a lot of stuff on women about [00:05:10] being able to cope after divorce and relationships. I mean, look at what's going on. Not that we want to start going down that track because that's got nothing to do with this. \n\n~But ~but yeah, there's women do have at heart, so [00:05:20] they're looking for help. ~I think there's a focus of International Women's Day coming up in March. So, you know, there's good opportunity for posting stuff there. ~Yeah, I mean, I think one of the most underused ~ ~tactics in business is SEO, like on your [00:05:30] website being found by a search term.\n\nAnd what would people normally search for is I don't know. In this case, ~I'm,~ I'm running out of money before the month gets [00:05:40] over and I need some help on how I can make that you know, not a catastrophe or something that effect maybe. So you're [00:05:50] trying to come up in a search for all those searches that your people are trying to.\n\nAnd not only that, in your email [00:06:00] signature, you're saying, if you are a woman and want 50 ways that you can actually manage your money right now, here's a link. So, because everyone's clicking on that [00:06:10] link and because people are being referred to, hopefully, all these references that are in here, when you link to them, they will accept the link and then that article [00:06:20] grows in value ~on, on,~ on the internet.\n\nThen this becomes a very valuable. piece of real estate on your website. And that's what I'm trying to create here for you. And [00:06:30] you've got to create that for your audience. ~And, and so, so,~ so it did that research. If you look, it took seven minutes 22 sources. And it did [00:06:40] it according to the three categories.\n\nIt gave you references, \n\n~which is.~\n\nSo this is the inspirational piece. Educate yourself. So this is obviously taking my voice style and that's why [00:06:50] it's writing it like this. So you'll have your own voice style. \n\n~Crazy. And, and this might be,~ this might be tackle high interest debt first might be like an obvious thing. It's not obvious to everyone. And ~I've,~ [00:07:00] I've seen that in person. That's right. I mean, you would tell them, you would say, Simple answer is spend less than you earn, pay the highest interest debt first.\n\nAnd they would look at me as if there was something [00:07:10] I was keeping back from them. It can't be as simple as that, but it is. ~ ~And this happens with a lot of people. ~ ~I mean, everything you're pulling up there is just, ~ ~for me, [00:07:20] generic. ~ ~Yeah, but it's not for you, ~dude.~ You're not the audience. I understand that.\n\nAnd that's the mistake that we make a lot, is that we think ~it's for,~ it's not for us at [00:07:30] all. In fact, the more you can say. And this, I'm, I'm saying this, I'm talking about, I got this from [00:07:40] Gary who told me straight up that I'm not saying the same thing and repeating, because I think I want to be smart. \n\nAnd ~I, and I was,~ he was totally right. Because I wanted to sound smart, I kept [00:07:50] changing because I've heard it so many times. But I've got to repeat it so many times that it's boring as fuck for me, but everyone knows to repeat it. They know [00:08:00] exactly what I am. They know exactly what I stand for. And that's as simple as that. \n\nAnd in this instance, it's not for you to know. This is for you to create a resource. So ~ ~don't mix [00:08:10] the two things up. It's a very different reason to create this. ~ ~And this is only a start, by the way, and I thought this was, this was fantastic. To be able to create something like this. And this is just me, [00:08:20] you know using you as an example.\n\nThank you for that, ~Nobby. It was,~ that was very, very useful, I think, not only for me but ~as a, you know,~ for everyone ~in here, I'm sure. Yeah, thank you. Scott, you have a question? Or anyone else have a question? I'd love to answer them. Yeah. Yeah,~ I ~just, ~correct me if I'm wrong, but [00:08:30] did you not say in your own podcast that you were sourcing previous podcasts and that your sample experiment in the last day or [00:08:40] two, it was pulling information from your own material.\n\n~Is that,~ did I hear that correctly? ~ ~Yeah, that was one of my examples. Yeah, 100%. Okay, because ~Nabi knows, and this is for all of us,~ I know, I have [00:08:50] moments of genius. And I also have a plethora of information. I'm working on something. I'm a little time crunched. ~ ~I could lose it. I can't find it. But what you're showing [00:09:00] us is that not only can you call all that information from the world, from all the schmies, yourself, I mean, your podcast, you've had [00:09:10] shows with subject matter experts on there, you.\n\nYou could try to remember it and some of us are really good at that and some of us are terrible at it But this is [00:09:20] pulling it for you. Wow. ~ ~Yeah, I mean, there's your You're a podcaster. Sorry, you're a podcaster And if you increase ~your ~your viewership or your listeners by 10 [00:09:30] percent and then you go out and you attract a new sponsor ~ ~There's your business case right there.\n\nOne of probably many where you can justify 2, 400 bucks. Boom, done. [00:09:40] Piece of cake is amazing. I'm not, I'm not with my own use case, but ~to your point, Scott, ~ to your point, ~Scott,~ if you noticed, [00:09:50] like when it comes up, nobody's like, Oh yeah, I know that. I know that when it comes up, you know it for sure. Like no one's denying~ the the.~\n\nThe expertise or the [00:10:00] credibility, ~it's,~ it's more like,~ it's more like,~ can they all be in one spot or ~can,~ can it be ~if,~ if you've already, ~like, if, if nobby already~ has podcasts out or already [00:10:10] has articles written, then just create this. from those articles and just kind of reference them. That's a way to do it.\n\nBut again, [00:10:20] this is a very specific use case. And the use case is to create ~ ~a big guide that becomes the center pillar for your audience [00:10:30] to always go to. And not only do they go to it, they tell other people who are the same to, Hey, this is this great, this is great resource that I think you should check out.[00:10:40] \n\nIt's as simple as that. It's nothing other than. ~ ~This is my spot, my real estate ~on, on, on the, on the,~ on the internet. And then you can start creating social around it as well and start to [00:10:50] like really, really boost that. So yeah, good point. Thanks for showing us this. And you know, I got a couple of newsletters I listened to, and I mean, I'm not the power user that [00:11:00] you are, but I am.\n\nSo grateful. And I mean, it's a moving target. That's moving light speed. You, you bring stuff up every week [00:11:10] and I just think, ~ ~thank you. You know, and then I mentioned it to my peers who are all developers, engineers, they're smart people, PhDs. And they're like, where are you getting this from? [00:11:20] Read Amplify AI.\n\nTalk to, talk to Ronsley. No, I'm really grateful to be here. Always. Thank you, Scott. You're making me blush, [00:11:30] even though, you know, you can't see it on my brown skin. Yeah, you were beat, you were beaten as a child and never loved, right? So, we gotta, we [00:11:40] gotta fix you up. ~Thanks, Scott. Scott, the other Scott.~\n\n~How are you? Good. Good. ~I wonder if that's really interesting. Like, how it does the does the research is like, have you played around with it yet? Whether or not you can give it your own context or your own private files to [00:11:50] research. ~I didn't~ I didn't give it my private files, but I did give it my website and my podcast.\n\nSo I'm thinking about, like, I'm thinking about, like, in, like, in our [00:12:00] company, we have, like, you know, we have things behind a firewall and then if you expose that and say, look at nothing about onboarding new employees, right? And like, they don't know what to ask. It's like, hey, can you [00:12:10] build a build an onboarding plan off of my all the data that you have out there? \n\nYeah, you could do that. I, I would be, again, this is a privacy thing that I feel is really, [00:12:20] really important to address. So ~the, ~the US companies do an amazing job at marketing themselves as the credible people. And an amazing job at pointing at the others [00:12:30] who don't look like them as the ones that are not doing the right thing, right.\n\n~But I want to, I want, it's, it's,~ it's across the board. I feel this, I'm tool agnostic. That's why I have [00:12:40] all these different accounts is ~I, I, ~I don't propose any tool. I think they're all, the, the goal is intelligence and I don't want to be an intelligent being that [00:12:50] fears intelligence. I just wanna, you know, intelligence is intelligence.\n\nIt's just doesn't matter where it comes from. So if there's stuff that is already [00:13:00] behind a firewall and there's a reason it's behind a firewall, I would not put it here. Just I wouldn't. So that goes for any financial stuff that goes for people's data [00:13:10] that goes for even if you remove their names and put their data, that's just not right.\n\nAnd please don't do that. Even if you've done it in the past, just assuming never happened and just [00:13:20] don't do it again. ~But,~ but on the other hand, ~if you did some,~ if you took this same tool and say, look at all the onboarding stuff that exists, this is [00:13:30] my this is my business. This is where my people are.\n\nThis is how, ~ ~you know, these are some of the steps that we use to onboard them. Can you create for me a more comprehensive onboarding [00:13:40] process? ~ ~That's different. ~ ~So it makes us stop. Yeah, I think a lot of the questions that we come up with is like, I think about like, all the, ~you know, like, all the ~training sessions we've done internally and like, on our products and [00:13:50] things like that, that are just, it's hard to like, get that knowledge into somebody who's starting out.\n\nSo it's like, ~how do you, ~how could you aggregate all that, like, creating internal, like. ~ ~Tools that look at your that [00:14:00] you can use internal. That to me is really interesting. I mean, that wouldn't be exposed to me. I know there's open source models that you could possibly use to bring that in house to avoid that.\n\nBut I mean, your points well taken. If it's like, [00:14:10] as soon as you expose, you're putting it on the Internet as soon as you put it in the model. ~I mean, it was, you know, ~there's always that risk. So, but it just seems like that. That's a huge, a huge win. If you can figure out ~how to~ how to firewall that keep it.\n\n[00:14:20] Oh, you can you can. ~I did. I did.~ I did a training a free training ~at the start of the month.~ Like not last one, the one before that on, on deep seek and how to install it locally on your computer and [00:14:30] on your local computer, you can do what the fuck you want. ~ ~You can like. Literally cut Wi Fi and your computer is a Faraday cage and all the [00:14:40] intelligence lives here and you can put whatever you want in it ~ ~and it'll do ~and, and, and,~ and we installed DeepSeek R1, which is the reasoning model. \n\nSo, it [00:14:50] is pretty powerful for a local model that you could totally use. Yeah, and I would highly recommend you looking, I would highly recommend any company ~ ~that has [00:15:00] anything behind a firewall ~ ~to explore local models on their own computer and not use open AI or Gemini or Deep Seek or even [00:15:10] Deep Seek.\n\nI wouldn't use on the web. ~ ~It's very different. To having it on your computer, and that's the difference. I can't have open AI on my computer because it's not very [00:15:20] open. ~Right. Right. ~Deep Seek is open. So Mano, ~I wish,~ I wish you could, ~I wish you could unmute yourself and, and~ tell us he's just bought the 200 chat GPT and he's doing [00:15:30] research right now, which is crazy because he's been doing this dot board of clarity.\n\nAnd I know because Nat has been telling me that and Mano, ~you've,~ I know you can't respond back, but you, [00:15:40] you have your dot board of clarity and you have who your audience is. So use your audience. ~ ~And from that audience, multiple [00:15:50] articles on your website that become searchable and findable.\n\nBecause you have a very specific niche, ~if I remember correctly. I met Matt a long time ago. Yeah that's cool. All right team Scott that session was recorded and on school. Oh, yes. Thank you Scott. I forgot I did that. Yes, it is. It totally is. So yeah, go, go and get that. ~All right team, I love doing this by the way.\n\nSo I love that you're here. Thank you for, [00:16:00] thank you for coming. Thank you for playing. I think next week, I've got some really cool ones coming up. How to use AI to transcribe everything for free. ~You can,~ you don't even have to have a transcription paid service [00:16:10] anymore. I've got that coming up.\n\nI've got a few other things coming up. ~Next week ~I've got how to create a whole content ~ ~calendar ~and,~ and write the content just like you. ~It's a, it's a paid workshop, but it's like a hundred bucks. It's super cheap and it's totally accessible. And, and you, you know, it's more,~ it's more about you [00:16:20] getting the results.\n\n~And I, I know that the ones that attended the. The, the, the training last month got immense value out of it. So I'm very encouraged to keep doing these. So look out for that. It's on the school thing, but if you need anything, just send me an email and I will, and one of the team will, will respond. ~All right.\n\nThanks team. Talk to you soon. Have a good one. ~Cheers guys. Cheers. Big years.~"

    "transcript": "128. Vayner Media\n===\n\nAstha Avinash: [00:00:00] everybody had a chance to meet you at the beginning.\n\nAndrea Sullivan: And then you're just bringing in like family here. So thank you for spending the time with us. we're, everybody's all abuzz [00:00:10] about AI, but the thing I love about Ronsly is he actually, You know, kind of makes it real in the sense that he shows people how they can bring it into their day to day.\n\nAnd [00:00:20] so I love whole idea of how can we embrace things and bring it practically into our businesses and into our lives. So. I'm thrilled to have you here, Ronsley.\n\nAnyway, [00:00:30] appreciate you all being here.So our brother, Ronsley. Thank you for joining. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Thank you team.\n\nI do feel like friends and family. And [00:00:40] I'm really, really glad to have met you all in person. Last year, \n\nI know everyone's been asked like, what is the biggest thorn in the business? I feel [00:00:50] that AI can easily sort of start to deal with some of the problems that we've been having in our businesses for a while maybe.\n\nAnd Maybe we think [00:01:00] that it's too complex a problem to solve, usually what happens is with the idea of giving AI some work [00:01:10] to do, I find in the last couple of years, the best advice I've given others is use AI for the things that you're not good at first. [00:01:20] Normally what happens is people try to use AI for the things that they're really good at, like they're really good at copy.\n\nThey try AI for that and they go, oh, AI doesn't really do the copy like the way I do it. and the [00:01:30] easiest way to get the most leverage out of AI is to Use it for the things you're not good at. what is the biggest thorn in your business?\n\nAnd then you think I can help you solve, and we'll [00:01:40] get into that in a second. So a couple of things to start off with. The goal is that AI can be used a whole bunch of different things. [00:01:50] Most people think about using AI. to out beat their competitors or and I feel like there's a much better way to use AI.\n\nUse [00:02:00] AI to amplify the things that are working really well. So for example, if you're going into doing To implementing AI, [00:02:10] integrating AI into your business, the, the, if you're doing it by yourself, the first thing to get the most leverage is to use the things that you're not good at and use AI for that.\n\nBut if you want to get [00:02:20] the biggest leverage over time for your business, if you already have processes and frameworks that work and you know how they work, using AI to [00:02:30] get it done quicker, and I'll show you some examples is probably the easiest way to get it to get the most. Out of the implementation because for the last so many [00:02:40] years, whether it was with AI or with podcasting, it's basically what I've done is taken someone's genius and amplified it.\n\nand with both of those [00:02:50] platforms, you're actually using your genius and your greatness and amplifying it, whether it is through AI or [00:03:00] podcasting you will all get a copy of the deck, but. What you got to know is, for the first part of my career, I was talking to computers. The second part of my career, I was talking to humans.\n\nAnd now, those [00:03:10] two parts have just come together and become AI. The first book was Amplify. The second book was Amplify AI. and I've spent a lot of time distilling [00:03:20] uh, what it takes to, Put your genius into a podcast and then take your genius amplify it using A.\n\nI. But 13 years ago, maybe a bit longer. This picture was [00:03:30] 13 years ago. I was a chef in a restaurant. My first business was a restaurant because I thought everyone's got to eat. Right? And everyone told me that I had to monetize my passion. You know, this story because [00:03:40] I spoke to you guys in, in, in New York about it.\n\nBut this was just before the restaurant shot and the restaurant shot kind of overnight [00:03:50] with its service on Saturday, on Sunday, the locks were changed. And it was really interesting because that was when I learned to become an entrepreneur, to [00:04:00] find out what the market needs and then. Not necessarily build it because there's this idea of building them that they will come, which is what I did with the [00:04:10] restaurant.\n\nBuilt it 260 grand down before I opened the doors and someone gave me 10 for my, for the first meal. I was like, Oh, this [00:04:20] seems hard. And it just seemed like an uphill battle from there. But now with the ability to have, you know, digital media, it's so [00:04:30] much easier. SoFor 2025, at leastopen yourself to new ideas and new ways of doing business.\n\nI think things are changing quite drastically. I believe [00:04:40] artificial intelligence will easily be the biggest conversation of our lifetime. Things have changed already so quickly. We just got announced. Like [00:04:50] I think a few hours ago VLC is like the famous media player. It's free. It has been free forever.\n\nVLC, you can download it and it'll play any sort of media [00:05:00] file. They have just incorporated live. Transcription as part of their free media player. So [00:05:10] transcription used to be a business where I remember paying a dollar a minute to get transcriptions because, you know, we did podcasts for like a lot of people and there was a time for us to get the [00:05:20] show notes or to create any sort of media.\n\nWe needed to pay the dollar a minute to get the transcription first. And now that is just not even a [00:05:30] thing, you know, so things are changing and I would assume that it will change in your space as well. And I would ask you to be the leader to change [00:05:40] that. I'm going to look at the chat, but what I think is really useful is, is having, having this template filled out.\n\nAll right. I am [00:05:50] X who helps Y achieve Z. I'm unique because ABC. What I might do is just put that into the, into the chat and when you [00:06:00] get a chance, if you can if you can fill out this for me for each one of you, that would be amazing. While I look at what's in here, biggest thorn in [00:06:10] our business.\n\nThat AI could help with. I'm in accounting. I feel like AI should be able to help me.\n\nI don't know enough to Oh my God. Yeah, of course, Diana. It's going to help you. [00:06:20] It's this in accounting and numbers. But I think there's a big difference between intelligence and computing and I'll talk about that in a second. But yeah, I mean, it's super [00:06:30] helpful. Use AI for business intelligence.\n\nJeff, you know, clarification on what you mean by business intelligence. That would be interesting for your [00:06:40] business. Program management. Detail plans, that's easy to do. So, for the people that I hear, Jeff, Brad, Diana Diana, William, [00:06:50] Priya, if you can, if you can use that template and fill it out to the best of your abilities, I am X who helps Y achieve Z, I'm unique [00:07:00] because ABC, and the reason for that is it gives us context, and with that context we can do a lot of really cool things using AI.\n\nAnd that will [00:07:10] help us use AI to sort of reverse engineer templates. So if you can, if you could fill that out and put that in the chat, that would be amazing. [00:07:20] Please.\n\nJeff Schuppe: Ronsley, can you give an example if this was you answering this question? \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah, I'm an AI consultant who helps business founders [00:07:30] who have, oh, it's you. Help business founders who build something amazing to their genius into AI powered systems that actually works. So I [00:07:40] am designation who helps audience, which is why achieve Zed, which is outcome.\n\nSo I am a computer [00:07:50] an AI consultant who helps audience, which is business founders who have methods and frameworks and a business over a million dollars achieve [00:08:00] integration with AI to do things quicker and save two hours a day. Does that help?\n\nJeff Schuppe: Yep, that's good. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Thanks. Yeah. [00:08:10] And then I can add that I'm unique because, you know, I have you know, I'm I can program 21 languages. I have written a book. I've got results. [00:08:20] You can just keep adding what those uniqueness is, are. My framework works. I have a framework that works. So the uniqueness is up to you\n\nSo the goal is that by today's [00:08:30] session, that we'll do some work in the session. the idea is that I want to not give you to have a bigger to do list than you already have, but maybe we can start to, [00:08:40] to dig into some of the things that you're trying to deal with right now. \n\nbefore we start the three main concepts I want to cover, the first is the value alignment problem.\n\nThis is a [00:08:50] problem that \n\nexists in Computer science and has been forever in the sense that when when a programmer goes to a client and [00:09:00] says you know, the client says, this is what I want. The programmer goes. Okay. Let me take all your requirements and I'll write them down. Then I will go away. [00:09:10] thing, test the thing, and I'll come back and I'll show you the thing done.\n\nAnd that used to be called the waterfall method of creation. And what used to happen is there was a [00:09:20] value alignment problem from the way the customer described what they wanted to the way the programmer understood what needed to be made. So there's [00:09:30] this gap in specifying the objective we have in our head completely and correctly.\n\nAnd. To combat that, Agile methods were [00:09:40] created. Now, luckily, I wrote a thesis in Agile methods, and what it does is it sort of breaks down that cycle from a [00:09:50] waterfall method to shorter iterations. So you have these cycles where you say, Okay, what do you want, Mr. Customer, or Mrs. Customer, or Miss Customer?[00:10:00] \n\nAnd you go, and they say, this is what I want. And you're like, okay, let me make an MVP of that. And in one week, I'll show you what that MVP looks like. And then they [00:10:10] show them the MVP and then the customer goes, Oh, yes, but not really. I kind of wanted it this way and that way. And then they make those changes and those small [00:10:20] iterations help us reduce the value alignment problem.\n\nDoes that make sense, team? Yeah. So the first concept is that it's [00:10:30] hard for us to express entirely what's in our brain. So, normally, if you're not getting what you want out of AI, it's because there's a value alignment [00:10:40] problem. Okay, that's the first concept. The second concept I want to introduce you to is the one of reducing human cognitive load.\n\nNow, In general, [00:10:50] we can see how there is this rise of depression, anxiety, too much workload, overwhelmed. that is common. [00:11:00] And instead of using AI to replace people, use AI to reduce their cognitive load. We're all leaders here and we all lead [00:11:10] a bunch of people. And if you could give them a superpower that Would negate their biggest weakness.\n\nYou would be [00:11:20] the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nI think that's the goal. The goal for us is how can we reduce our human cognitive load as well as that of our team. \n\nIn terms of reduction of [00:11:30] cognitive load, you consider yourself to have human intelligence. You can augment that with artificial intelligence and then align that.\n\nWith divine intelligence for the greater good, [00:11:40] and then you can use intelligence to really make a difference in your businessin your industry for your people. know for a fact that [00:11:50] human intelligence lacks in a lot of ways. We're very bad at memory, extremely bad at memory, while artificial intelligence is really good at memory.\n\nSo. [00:12:00] Augments the intelligence in and use artificial intelligence for what it's good at and use human intelligence for what it's good at. All right. The last thing I'm going to say is wearing [00:12:10] socks. I had this friend that asked me, how do I wear my socks? And I'm like, what do you mean? One leg at a time.\n\nAnd he, that's not what he was asking me. He asked me how I wear my socks in the [00:12:20] sense whether I wear my socks inside out or just like the way normal people do. It's like everyone wears the socks normally. And he goes, why would you want [00:12:30] the stitching of the socks to be on the inside for you to deal with the stitching while you're walking through your day?\n\nWhy don't you just flip the socks around? And [00:12:40] I'm like, what? That is so simple. and since then I've been wearing my socks the other way around. So for 40 years, I've been wearing socks the wrong way. [00:12:50] And I would encourage you to think. Or what I thought was the right way, but it could be one better.\n\nwhile you're listening to this and we're doing today's session. I think [00:13:00] there are ways that you can wear your socks differently that will actually benefit you. \n\nI want you to do a brain dump, like, literally all the things you have on your mind. That you have to [00:13:10] do just say, I want to, I've got to do this. I've got to go give the dog a bath, whatever it is.\n\nI've got to pay the team, [00:13:20] whatever is your list. I want you to go. I'm going to put a minute on the clock and I would love you to just dictate to your phone. All right. One [00:13:30] minute.\n\nAll right. How'd you go? Everyone got that note? Yeah. Yeah. Great. Now what I'd like you to do, I'm [00:13:40] going to.\n\nopen chat GPT or\n\nyou can use Claude, you can use Gemini, you can use Grok. It doesn't matter what AI you use. What I'd like you to do is [00:13:50] say. Organize this in a logical manner, and I want you to just paste, [00:14:00] just don't even correct whatever that is, just paste that in the brackets there in your AI and hit enter, please.\n\n[00:14:10] So organize this in a logical manner, and then copy your dictation and paste it in there. How\n\nare you going, team? Can I help?\n\nDid [00:14:20] anyone execute already?\n\nYeah, Diana, do you want to unmute and tell me? \n\nDiana Gleason: So I literally brain dumped. This was really cool. And then it made [00:14:30] me a to do list of like my work tasks that I need to get done my self care tasks. I need to get done my personal home tasks. I broke it up into household errands and then like weekend [00:14:40] activities.\n\nRonsley Vaz: It's beautiful. It is. So now what I'd like you to do is I say. Say you can now you can say things like for me to feel really productive. what is the thing [00:14:50] that I could do right now to take off the list or you can ask it to organize it to home in a way, or you can ask it give me the task [00:15:00] that can be done in the in 1 minute, like, or give me the task that I need to dedicate time to and put in the calendar.\n\nSo now that you have that brain [00:15:10] dump. And it's organized for you. There's so many things that you can do, but not only that it has reduced overwhelm. If you feel like it's, if you [00:15:20] feel it, like it's something going, Oh, I've captured that somewhere. \n\nDiana Gleason: Yeah, yeah, this is great. Now I can be like, [00:15:30] organize this to tell me what to do on Saturday and what to do on Sunday.\n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah, yeah, \n\nSo this is something that you can totally use, [00:15:40] right? You can totally use that as soon as you feel overwhelmed. The first thing I want you to do is pick up your phone, open the notes. And just brain dump [00:15:50] all the things that you have on your mind, even that act in itself is going to reduce the overwhelm.\n\nThen the next thing from there is to take that and then organize that in a logical manner. And [00:16:00] then the next thing from there is to take that and then execute on the things. And in that, just in that, you're going to start to reduce a lot of your human [00:16:10] cognitive load. You'll feel less tired. Okay. So what I've noticed over the last couple of years, implementing AI.\n\nDifferent companies and different [00:16:20] businesses that there are these. Three S's that stop us from implementing AI properly. The first is that there's scaling limits in business. There's [00:16:30] scaling limits. Like we can't scale without human hours. And that's a problem that we need to fix. The second problem is that there's a system overwhelm.\n\n[00:16:40] There's lots of AI options and there's lots of complexity and everyone seems to know what they're talking about and everyone's an expert. So we just kind of go and we see these tools and we start getting tools [00:16:50] and there's new things coming out every day and every week and we're like, I don't even know what to do next.\n\nThat's the second problem to solve. And the third is [00:17:00] that there's a strategy gap because there's no clear. AI implementation strategy. So for us to overcome that, the first thing to do is to overcome scaling limits is to create [00:17:10] connection. Now, connection is the ability to amplify human connection while scaling and not that every company knows how difficult that is, but with AI, [00:17:20] it can be made easier.\n\nThe second thing is with System Overwhelm is to have clarity and a clear AI implementation roadmap and with the strategy, [00:17:30] you increase capability and deploy proven systems that already exist and not you're trying to create new ones for yourself [00:17:40] for each of these. Now, there's like these. three Ps for each of them.\n\nSo for connection, you, you first want to extract personality, [00:17:50] and then you want to make sure that you have a way to check the style and consistency. And then there is a way to train your AI. [00:18:00] To do exactly what you wanted to do that's how you create connection to create clarity. You first map all the processes that work, [00:18:10] then you create, you insert AI into those processes and create architecture and then use the pyramid.\n\nAnd I've written about that in detail in the book, [00:18:20] so I don't really want to go into the pyramid part, but I'm just giving you an overview of. What happens when you're trying to implement A. I. into your business. And [00:18:30] finally, once you have connection and clarity to implement capability, you start implementing the A.\n\nI. Tools and then start to determine performance and increase [00:18:40] productivity. So that is the way to actually implement in the right steps. But what happens right now is people go straight [00:18:50] to tools and they start buying the tool and then the tool doesn't do what it's supposed to do. And then you go back and forth.\n\nAnd in the meantime, you've lost connection with your team. You've [00:19:00] lost connection with your audience and you've lost connection with yourself because you're trying to fit this tool into the system as opposed to [00:19:10] getting the right tool for your system. so Flip that around."

You know, not the obvious one, which is the kayak, which you just go around and have a yak. But, you know, the other piece of building a buzz, how do you go about preparing for the show, recording and then editing to create an engaging piece of content?\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: I think a lot of it comes down to the things that I find interesting and trying to hone in on those a little bit. half of it is kind of like me talking about things I've learned. And then the other half of it is hopefully having some guests on and discussing with things they've learned.\r\n\r\nAnd really like I want to answer questions that People ask me on the day to day and I want to ask questions that I'm curious about from other people and I think like the curiosity side of a podcast is where a lot of people find value is when people have similar curiosities. You can get a lot of listeners around [00:01:00] that.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as far as like preparing and doing it's that's always been a struggle for me is like, I actually don't like having a schedule and I like just random stuff popping up throughout the day and throughout the week and whatever, which is kind of hard sometimes to live a normal life but like I'd like that like I don't know why I just do. And so, that's been a struggle for me isI know that I could probably. succeed quicker with a podcast if I have like a, Hey, every Tuesday I'm doing X, Y, and Z for X hours. And this is going to happen. and that is like what I'm working towards now, because I want to see more come from the time that I am putting into it.\r\n\r\nAnd I want it to be more of a regular thing. And I think like the structure part of it is the part that I struggle with the most. from start to finish like I got to schedule it, and then I've got to actually do it and then I've got to go sit down and edit it, and then I've got to get the clips from it, and then I've got to [00:02:00] post the clips, and so it feels like there's a lot to it, but like, There's so many tools nowadays that has actually made that process like so much more efficient.\r\n\r\nI mean, you know, probably better than literally anyone in this world, like, That process for you when you started, I can't imagine how different it is now, right? Like, can you guess like how much time maybe you've saved in the last on podcast compared to when you first started, like, it's probably insane.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: that's fascinating in terms of that you still feel like you've got You know, stuff to do and stuff to grow and places to kind of really improve on the podcast. Cause that's the thing I find the most is I definitely feel I get better every 20 episodes.\r\n\r\nI'd say I can see a difference if I listen back. And I would say I get more. Anything with more reps, the more you do, the better you get. I mean, AI is to your point about how much this has changed AI in the last year has. So what used to take 12 hours has been reducing a lot [00:03:00] over the last few years, but last year that change just went to minutes.\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: Yeah.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: And, Things that you can do now at speed is absolutely, actually the longest thing that, you do is actually you watching the thing, and kind of going, okay, this is good. this is what I want to put out. And that's, what's taking more time than the editing and the pulling out of the content and all of that stuff.\r\n\r\nSo what's fascinating is all the artists right now don't have an excuse. for not executing because all this while someone with the best strategy didn't get results because they didn't execute because they didn't know how to or they didn't know how to, do that at speed and also without the learning curve.\r\n\r\nAnd now with AI, that's all possible. How are you using it? Are you using it at all? I mean, a kayak, I don't know how AI fits Yeah.\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: I actually use it more than probably I would say most people you probably use it more than me, but but I think like in my [00:04:00] day to day conversations, I'm like, Oh, you don't use AI for that, you know, and like, why not?\r\n\r\nAnd I think a big one is just something as simple as like a note taker during meetings, right? I used to have to like have one screen up with my notes and I'm like typing as the other screen, I'm like talking, and now I can just focus on the conversation. let that thing take my notes, give me a summary and a to do list and so on and so forth afterwards.\r\n\r\nThat alone has saved me so much time. But like I've created, you know, custom GPTs for our admins and actually after the 4Ds thing, like I threw in the entire presentation and like tried to create cohorts around, you know, you know, different customer segments and like made a custom GPT for that and I try to figure out ways that will help not just me but like all of the franchisees.\r\n\r\nSo if there's ways that they can [00:05:00] go and interact with it to answer questions rather than having to come to me. I've tried like so many different things but I think at the end of the day like the thing that it saves me the most time with is. meetings and then coming up with ideas, I think is a really important thing that I've used it forsometimes you don't have anyone else to talk to you, open it up and you ask it a couple of questions and you've got your answer quicker than you would have got to that answer in the past.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Right. And so like, That's probably the main use cases that I use it for. That's interesting you say custom gpt because like a week ago I had this meeting with and you saw must have seen the post 'cause I made a reel about it. I had this meeting about a custom gpt and this guy was about to spend, I dunno, a hundred grand for this guy to put all his IP into a custom GPT.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm like, dude, How is this save? I How is it going to safeguard your IP? And he goes, Oh, don't worry. Like the instructions will not give up. it was like, hold my coffee, dude. And I got the instructions, not only the [00:06:00] instructions, I got the instructions of his instructions, not to give me the instructions andit's so hilarious about what is competency these days around AI, but I love the fact that, what's.\r\n\r\nis very evident is that it's intelligence and everyone feels more intelligence as a result of using it. Of course, they're going to feel more competent. It's a natural, I think, a response to, you know, using intelligence. So it's a good thing that I suppose people are feeling competent. The problem is that with marketing, The marketers are doing a good job to tell other people how competent they really are,\r\n\r\nso it's really interesting. I asked you the question about how this is gonna affect kayaking. Yesterday I got asked to be on this company that is using heart rate variability and AI to increase our vibration so that we. Vibrate at a higher frequency. And I'm like, wait, what are you doing\r\n\r\nI, that blew me away. I was like, I, I'm in like, where do I sign? what's part? How do I get [00:07:00] part of, so how is the kayaking business changing as a result? Is it changing at all? Do you see anything? Like, do you see you know, business changing in any way?\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: on that level is a little bit, I think further down the road for us, but I think on the level of like the customer's journey and the customer's experience of like booking with the kayak company and, They're interactions with the kayak company like that's where short term changes is definitely happening.\r\n\r\nYou know, so I think it's like for me like Google has, AI answering questions now right and so like, how does my business show up as that AI answer when someone says, What is the best kayak tour in Florida? And so that's a big one that I think about a lot, but I think like just in general, a customer's journey is going to get more efficient.\r\n\r\nIt's going to get easier. People are going to find what they want to do faster. And I'm here to try and facilitate that on [00:08:00] my end of things as much as I can. So whether that means putting out more content, whether that means refining our booking flow, whether that means creating chat bots that can answer questions quicker than a human can.\r\n\r\nLike, I think just the customer experience of the entire process, the entire customer journey is where a lot of changes are going to happen. The on the water experience, I kind of feel like that's where You don't need the AI to adjust much. I do think like we've thrown some of our talking points and ideas into it.\r\n\r\nAnd it has refined those over time. And like, you know, I don't even think the customer realises that's happened. And I don't necessarily want them to, you know, when they're doing this in person experience with other human beings, like, I don't know how much AI I want to introduce to that, but I think like the backend and the efficiencies and the bookings and whatever, that's where I want to dig in a little bit and see where I can [00:09:00] make things easier for everyone,\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: that's exactly what I want people to think about when they think about AI is the augmentation of human intelligence with artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nAnd that's The whole book. that is exactly where you're supposed to be taught. It's exactly how you're supposed to use AI. Most people kind of use AI with what they're already good at. Oh, I'm a great copywriter. Let me use AI.\r\n\r\nIt can't write good copy. Of course it can't write good copy. You've had how many hours of training? And how much content have you put out? It's very different to, I hate writing emails. Yeah, that's where you use AI, right? You use AI to augment your weaknesses so that you can focus on your strengths and you've obviously got a huge strength.\r\n\r\nin the kayak. There's no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater and, look at all the other things that you couldn't do before and absolutely apply AI to that. So, I'm glad that I'm having this conversation primarily because for me, that's what I care about the most. I'm care, I care about how people can augment the [00:10:00] experiences and how can they not kind of go this or that and go, wait, if this is an end, the whole thing is way better.\r\n\r\nyou can potentially give your employees a four day week because you use AI and have the, best work life balance culture around by using AI. But people are thinking, no, I got to leave these people around out because I'm going to use AI. That's not really the way to think about it, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: I think like, Just in general, I feel like people are thinking of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI and not everything else that's under the water, you know, under the surface. And yeah, people use it as like a quick little search tool or functionality. and\r\n\r\nthat's like my experience with other people using it is like, Oh, yeah, I've used it to like, ask it a few questions and give me a better understanding you know, some funny responses and create a little poem for me. And like, that's it, you gotta really put your feet in your customer shoes and see where you can make things [00:11:00] more efficient, how you can implement that into all of that.\r\n\r\nI would love to like hear your thoughts on where you think people are really missing out when it comes to AI. You know, are you seeing that like most people are just using it to try and like create a little bit of content or like, where are people missing out the most when it comes to AI?\r\n\r\nAnd I think like people think of AI as like only chat GPT too, right? maybe that's part of it.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: it's just when Facebook first came out and became the social media platform, everyone who had a Facebook account and posted a few times became a social media expert, right? When I started podcasting and I had just started the agency and I, ran the first podcasting conference in Australia and there were people who just started a podcast that were kind of going, I'm a podcast expert.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm like, wow, the C and I just wrote a book. I'm like, I don't even, I don't even know how to process this thing right now. So that's happening right [00:12:00] now in AI, because anyone that can use, that GPT or can create a custom GPT is claiming to be an expert to the ones that don't know how to do that or feel like they have this narrative that they're technically not inclined. So that is what probably the first thing I'd love for everyone to not worry about or not think about more and not give into that thought process that they're not technically inclined. Because now computers have gotten to a point where. It's all about the human interaction. When I started computing or getting involved, let's say this, my first programming language was in ones and zeros.\r\n\r\nSo from that, we went into hex code. So we had zero to two to nine and then eight F and then we could program in hex. So in that thing, and then it went into. code and from code now, yesterday, I just recorded a video. There's no, I can program in 21 languages, [00:13:00] but I'm kind of useless because it can program in all those languages and more because I can just say, write this.\r\n\r\nin this language and it'll write all the code that I need to get it to run. I don't even have to know what it does because that is insane. So how I feel people are not using it is they're not augmenting what they could do. For example, I was in New York and I had got back my manuscript.\r\n\r\nfrom the editors and she'd given me 16 or 17 pages of corrections to do. And when I saw you in New York, that was week five of seven that I had to give these corrections back. And I had not done anything because I didn't even know where to start. And there's a lot of things going on with the team and, you know, business and clients and other stuff.\r\n\r\nand then obviously Gary said something about inventing this vaccine and removing self belief and self confidence or something happened to me. And I was like, on the walk back to [00:14:00] where I was staying, I was like, I wonder if I could invent an AI to help me. in this current situation. So I created an AI just to tell me what tasks to do next.\r\n\r\nI said, here are all the tasks. You classify them. You categorize them. I don't want to know the list. I just want to know what to do next. And depending on how many I do in a row, you can decide how you want to give me the next task to do. There were 33 tasks because I asked it to count at the end. I finished them all in seven days. That is not humanly possible. It's not humanly possible. That was not possible three months ago.\r\n\r\nwe did not have the technology to do that three months ago. That is crazy for me. And I'll augment that with another thing that happened next because I did that. I was like, I've done about 90 podcast interviews on AI and I've interviewed Gary, I've interviewed Daniel Priestley and some Edmund Pagan and all these, you know, I'd love for them to be in the book. So I [00:15:00] was like, Hey, this is the manuscript of the book. It's complete. These are my podcasts. Tell me where and what I spoke about and how it fits into the book. Oh wow. It would have taken me and my team. Yeah.\r\n\r\nthat's how people are not using it, they're not thinking of it as a partner, as a teammate. And as an entrepreneur, we know this, the biggest jump is solopreneur to entrepreneur because we've got to explain exactly what we want from our head to other people. So, the same with AI, the better you get at explaining exactly what you want,\r\n\r\nSo what kind of like, when you look back at your entrepreneur career, like what kind of messages or pieces of advice that you got along the way that You're right. Oh, that made a huge difference that changed my perspective. It helped me, breathe better and deal with the situation differently.\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: I tell this to my franchisees a lot is like, for me at the end of the day, it's just kayaking.\r\n\r\nI think one of the other things that I've thought [00:16:00] a lot about too, is at the beginning of being an entrepreneur, it was like. I'm betting on the business working like I think this business is going to work because X, Y, and Z and I set the business up to do this and this.\r\n\r\nAnd now it's kind of changed to like the business is going to work because I'm part of the business, and because I'm who I am. And I've invested the time, effort and money into myself so that the business can continue to grow. and at the end of the day, like I know if hiking disappeared tomorrow, like because of who I am and what I've learned and what I've been through, I could go and create something else that I think would be meaningful.\r\n\r\nso I think like a little bit of the perspective change from like betting on the business to betting on yourself. And I've learned that in. eight years of being an entrepreneur,\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Dude, I think all that helped, all that was training, all that was reps and all that, made you the entrepreneur you are today.\r\n\r\nSo thank you for that. Ladies and gentlemen, [00:17:00] jbuzzy. com is where you go to find out all the cool stuff that Justin's up to.\r\n\r\nthank you so much for, for this this chat.\r\n\r\nJustin Buzzi: Yeah. Thank you so much"

    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=episode131",
    "transcript": "131. Prompting Framework with Vayner Media\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I want to quickly go into a prompting framework because I think this is very valuable for everyone that is kind of going to use AI and do it quickly.~\n\n~So I've got a,~ [00:00:00] I've got a prompting framework, the seven steps, and the seven steps is basically the idea of how you can delegate like an entrepreneur. Now, the biggest [00:00:10] jump that any business owner goes is from a solopreneur to an entrepreneur, ~because with. ~Going from a solopreneur to an entrepreneur, you have team and with team comes recruitment and operations and culture and [00:00:20] process and all these other elements that come as part of it.\n\nBut what happens is ~we can't, we,~ in that jump going from solopreneur to entrepreneur, we learn to delegate, [00:00:30] but sometimes we, and most times we don't delegate properly because ~we can't,~ we have the value alignment problem. We can't fully express exactly what we want a person to do [00:00:40] because. It's in our head and we think that they should have all this information that we already have.\n\nSo, use this framework to delegate. And [00:00:50] this framework you can use to delegate to AI. Like, you could use this to delegate to another human being. Alright? So, there are the seven steps that you [00:01:00] want the AI to know in your prompt. Okay? The first thing you want it to know is the result. What's the goal? That you're trying to achieve.[00:01:10] \n\nOkay. The 2nd is what is the essential pieces of information. Now, if you were giving that task to a person, what information does that [00:01:20] person need to execute on the prompt and do they know how to complete the task? All right, so that's the essential piece of information ~and, and I'm, I'm putting this in order of like importance.~\n\n~Okay,~ so the first [00:01:30] thing you need is the goal. The second is the essential information that you need to complete the goal. And the third is what is the final representation of the output look like? [00:01:40] What does that supposed to look like? So if you only have those three, your prompt is going to be better than most prompts out there.\n\nNow, if you add the next four [00:01:50] elements, it's going to be even better. If you, ~if, if,~ if you want an AI to act as a person, ~what would that,~ what would that entity be? If you say write an email, you'd want ~the, the,~ [00:02:00] the entity to be. ~Your ~your assistant as an example, if you were writing a marketing plan, you want the entity to be a marketing manager So give it more [00:02:10] context and it will improve the prompt so character The next thing is approach.\n\nSo if you already know what? ~ ~Approach or what process you want [00:02:20] AI to take, then say that I want you to do this first and then do this next and then do that afterwards. That will improve your prompt even further. Then you [00:02:30] say, well, now that you have all these essential pieces of information, I think you can make it even more relevant because this is the kind of person I'm talking to.\n\nAnd ~this is the kind of,~ this is what they care about. So then you're [00:02:40] refining and you're giving it even more context. And then finally you're saying, well, the output is for this person. So if you have all these seven elements in your prompt, you will [00:02:50] get exactly what you want out of AI. So if you prompt AI in this manner.\n\nYou will get exactly what you're after from AI. [00:03:00] I'll give you an example. ~All right. This is,~ this is what I'm after is a template for, you know, podcast guests that are coming onto my podcast. So ~I'll,~ I'll read this out. Act like my personal [00:03:10] assistant. And write me a template email for my podcast guests informing them about the episode going live.\n\nThe essential pieces of information is this is the episode number, this is [00:03:20] the date it gets released, these are the topics it covered, and here's where you can find the assets. Okay, that's essential. The approach I want you to take is, I want you to [00:03:30] first highlight their genius, Thank them, mention something unique about the episode, and then ask them to share it.\n\nIn the tailoring, I want you to be memorable [00:03:40] when you're creating this template, and I want the template to create conversation. The output should be in Ronsley's voice style, and the recipient is a podcast [00:03:50] guest that has appeared on the show. So you see how, instead of me just saying, write me an email template, this has get so much more context and it will give me [00:04:00] exactly what I want.\n\nAnd it won't even take a minute to fill out if you were doing this, but once you get used to it, you can just write the prompt on the go. ~You get, you get,~ you get good at [00:04:10] it. ~So that is, that is how you write a prompt. I wonder whether there's any questions on that that maybe I can answer. ~\n\nAndrea Sullivan: ~Ronzi, I have a question.~\n\n~Just do you, ~I know there are so many different platforms. When you went about that particular task, do you, have you been using chat GPT or cloud. [00:04:20] ai, or do you have any preferences or any suggestions on different platforms to use for what kinds of tasks? \n\nRonsley Vaz: So, so far, so what's going to happen is [00:04:30] different models are going to evolve differently.\n\nWhat's happening right now is everyone's using chat [00:04:40] GPT. So what is happening is any output from most outputs from chat GPT are being labeled as AI output. And everyone can read it [00:04:50] and go, Oh, that's AI, but it's actually chat GPT output. So even if you use Claude for writing marketing material, people won't even know the difference because it's [00:05:00] like such a different way of writing because it's a different model.\n\nSo I find Claude and Gemini really useful for writing marketing material. [00:05:10] Let me show you an example. ~So can you see my screen? ~\n\nJames Orsini: ~Yep. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. Okay. ~So this is Claude. All right. Now inside Claude, I have different projects, but I have this Amplify AI version two project [00:05:20] in here. In here, I have put who my audience is, my custom instructions, rules for writing LinkedIn posts.[00:05:30] \n\nAnd some examples of posts that I've worked before. Okay, let me show you how long it took me to write show notes yesterday. [00:05:40] So I literally took the transcript of the edited show notes. Oh, sorry, of the [00:05:50] edited podcast. And I put that in and I said, take the time to read this transcript. Because I have trained it and it knows exactly how to write in my [00:06:00] voice.\n\nIt took that, wrote the title. And then wrote the description in my voice Hey, Hey, AI Geeks, it's Ron Slee. ~Ever written,~ [00:06:10] ever written what you thought was a decent prompt only to get useless response? Today, I'm sharing how one simple line turns mediocre prompts into gold. And the best part, you [00:06:20] probably already know the information AI needs.\n\nYou're just not telling it properly. So ~it's actually,~ it's actually written that in my voice and better than I could have said it myself. And then wrote. The whole [00:06:30] description, and this took less than 30 seconds. So these posts are quite easy to write. Now I'll show you [00:06:40] another one that I wrote. \n\nJames Orsini: One thing on one of your webinars, I, I seem to remember you, you saying that obviously there, there's, we, we keep talking about chat [00:06:50] and, and Claude, but there is a plethora of AI that specializes in, Hey, if you wanna LinkedIn bio, use this ai. You know, [00:07:00] if you're looking to revise an old article to sound new, use this AI.\n\nYeah, \n\nRonsley Vaz: so that is, so once you go to chat GPT, [00:07:10] that's what I'm talking, what James is talking about is if you go to chat GPT on the left hand side here there is explore GPTs down the [00:07:20] bottom. And if you click on that, you get a whole bunch of different, very specific GPTs that. AIs that do very [00:07:30] specific functions.\n\nFor example this one that sort of is an AI humanizer. Now, you know, it's a good one because, you know, it's a decent one, at least, because there's [00:07:40] so many conversations and there's over, it's over four stars and there's over, you know, a thousand ratings and it's number two in, in, in writing. So you can [00:07:50] see how people are using it you know, for copy.\n\nThis one is for productivity. There's different ones that these are really, this was really useful for me when I was writing my [00:08:00] book to find different things that work, like consensus does research papers. So it goes and does all the literature review research papers that gives [00:08:10] you a bunch of research papers instead of you going to the library and finding them.\n\nVideo summarizer, you just put in the YouTube link and it'll summarize the video for you. So there's all these different ones that [00:08:20] in here, if you can just type LinkedIn. ~ ~And then it'll find you profile riders. So there's different tools that can be used already that are in here. This is what [00:08:30] James was talking about.\n\n~Yeah, it's, it's, it's like, ~it's like the biggest problem right now is there's so many tools you don't even know what to use. That's why you've got to go the other way. ~What, what, where does,~ where do you need help? And then look for the [00:08:40] tool for that rather than find the tool and see if it fits into your process.\n\nI'm just going to yeah, please go \n\nDiana Gleason: ask you a [00:08:50] quick question. So, something that is like, top of mind for my team, we're all remote and I'm updating my website and, you know, not everybody has the headshot they like [00:09:00] and then. They're like, can't AI make me a headshot? And I'm like, I, I think, but I don't know.\n\nI'll ask Ronsley. , . \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. There are a few. [00:09:10] I think flux.ai is probably one flux That does. Okay. Yeah. But ~I will,~ I will get you some names.~ I. I'm sure there are, you know, ~there are ones that keep improving, and I know that our video team [00:09:20] uses some of them, so I'm just going to ask them which ones they use.\n\nOkay. Yeah,~ and I'll, and I'll,~ and I'll yeah, I'll get back to you. \n\nJames Orsini: Thank \n\nRonsley Vaz: you. ~But yes, you can totally, ~\n\nJeff Schuppe: ~yeah. I have another quick question. Oh, yes, please. Sorry, Avery. ~What about secured [00:09:30] information? I know, you know, if you're just out there on chat GPT without a pro, it just goes out into the wild. But if you do [00:09:40] pro you might be behind the firewall.\n\nIf you're trying to look for all these different ones, you know, just like Netflix and Hulu and Paramount plus all of a sudden you've [00:09:50] got 80. Subscriptions that you don't know what to do with and how to manage. How do you worry about secured? You know look into ai \n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:10:00] so what's the information that you're trying to secure jeff? \n\nJeff Schuppe: Well, I mean i'm not too worried about marketing type stuff for my personal brand and things like that but if I do get into [00:10:10] business intelligence, in other words~ if I ~If I want to take anything proprietary to my company, you know, financials or our secret sauce or anything like that, but I want to [00:10:20] write it into a presentation and not have it be out ~into the,~ into the world.\n\nHow do I do that? \n\nRonsley Vaz: So it's super hard. So [00:10:30] there's a big difference between information and intelligence and. It's extremely hard if you use in whatever way inside [00:10:40] chat GPT, for example, you say, this is our secret source. Can you help me do X, Y, Z. It is super difficult for [00:10:50] anyone, including chat GPT to go back and find that information unless.\n\nYou keep using that to train the model. [00:11:00] Now, what I mean by that is there are, there are some of them that are already out in the, in the universe. For example, my method is already in the book, right? So it's already [00:11:10] kind of published. The different methods, frameworks that are already exist, like the SWOT analysis.\n\nEveryone knows how. to implement a SWOT analysis. But your method is [00:11:20] so unique to you that someone has to recall that so many times for that to actually become a thing.~ And I don't think that that's going to be ~I don't think anyone can retrieve that information easily is the [00:11:30] first thing I'm going to say unless it is client information.\n\nNow, what I, what, what you don't want to do is say Ronsley Vars. That lives here with [00:11:40] this mobile number and this email address, so that data you want to avoid putting into touch it because then that is. [00:11:50] Personal information of people that you don't want to put in there, but your stuff in terms of this is how we do things [00:12:00] is super difficult to retrieve.\n\nOkay. But if you really want to be specific that you would use the API. And so the [00:12:10] API for ChatGPT or any of the AIs do not train the model so that whatever you're using, that information ~is not gone,~ doesn't [00:12:20] go to train the model. Okay, so you're going to use it separately from the actual interface for you to actually do that the way you want to do it.\n\nAvery Patrick: I have a [00:12:30] question if, if that answers your question, Jeff. Hi, Ronsley. If we miss this. But, I was wondering, my chat GPT upgraded to the like [00:12:40] 200 subscription, do you think I could possibly be doing anything that actually needs that? Oh, yeah. I mean, Sora is like super valuable if you can start [00:12:50] to create some some videos.\n\nRonsley Vaz: Let me just share screen again. But what if we're not doing video? Oh yeah. I mean, [00:13:00] there's a lot that depends on how much you, you're actually using it right now. Are you, how much are you using it every? I use it all the time. I talk to it at night before [00:13:10] bed.\n\nJames Orsini: It's cheaper than a husband. I sit in the cat \n\nVayner Media Member - 8: with it at night. She has a very nice husband. I do. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I think, I think it's very,~ I think 200 ~is,~ is for me, is like a no brainer, ~even though I I think, but do you find~ if you're [00:13:20] using it all the time, it's 200 is nothing. Right. So I don't think. Okay. But I do think that you should play with Sora~ and it, like, they're creating some crazy images.~\n\n~Like,~ just imagine these videos would have to, how [00:13:30] much you have to do to actually get them filmed. Yeah. Like, you know, two months ago, this was not even possible. ~One second. ~\n\nDiana Gleason: ~Sorry. Okay. Thank you. ~How do you [00:13:40] make these? Like, ~what do you tell it to make you?~ You can tell it to make you a video. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. \n\nDiana Gleason: Like, I'm just a dope.\n\nI'm sorry. Like this. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. Yeah. So \n\nDiana Gleason: that looks really cool. [00:13:50] Yeah. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. Sorry. Dot com. And you can even go through them and see what prompts have been used. So, so if you go here and you click on that, it'll say, okay, [00:14:00] here is the prompt. That's used. \n\nAstha Avinash: Okay. \n\nRonsley Vaz: So then you can just take this prompt and then edit it to how you want it to look [00:14:10] cool.\n\nYeah. And then there's some, there's some ridiculously cool ones in here. \n\nWill: I always wonder what happens if you put in a prompt that is completely [00:14:20] unrealistic.\n\nGive me an example. Can you make a video that makes accounting cool. ~So that's so generic and, and. Well, I mean, that's not like, it's like, you know, I talked to Diana about it. Like, it's how do you make content that makes accounting cool? So ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~you can,~ if you define what cool is, it'll do that. So define what you mean by cool and say, [00:14:30] this is what I mean by cool.\n\nLike for me, yeah, \n\nDiana Gleason: like, so Will, like I would do something like make accounting look sexy and appealing to [00:14:40] women creatives. Right. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Like, get real \n\nDiana Gleason: specific like that. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Even more specific. What does sexy and appealing mean? What is appealing [00:14:50] to women? ~What is,~ what is sexy? What is sexy? Okay. Make \n\nDiana Gleason: accounting, right?\n\nMake a woman feel empowered as fuck, right? Like, something. \n\nRonsley Vaz: What, what does the empowered [00:15:00] look like? The women would feel like they have control over their finances. Like what does that look like? \n\nDiana Gleason: Right. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Even describe \n\nDiana Gleason: that even further. Yes. Okay. Okay. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah, [00:15:10] more context better context is everything. I've got a few more slides that I want to cover if that's cool.\n\nVayner Media Member - 8: Go ahead. Am I on? You're on. [00:15:20] Oh. My mom has a question. Ronsley? \n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. Hey. \n\nVayner Media Member - 8: Hi. How are you? \n\nRonsley Vaz: Amazing. How are you? \n\nVayner Media Member - 8: Good. I,~ sorry, we were late. I, so again, it's a dumb question, I think, but ~if I put stuff in there that [00:15:30] is like, ~like, ~proprietary, does it get stolen? \n\nRonsley Vaz: No, ~I was just saying that to Jeff, like it's super hard for some,~ it's like, it's not search So it's not like once it's there, someone can search for it and [00:15:40] find it.\n\nIt's a neural network. It's not, this information is stored here that I can easily retrieve it. That's not what happens. [00:15:50] \n\nVayner Media Member - 8: Okay, thank you.~ I'm sorry I missed that before. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~No, that's all. That's okay. That's good. Let me just share this because I want to show you a ~\n\nJames Orsini: ~question on that. It doesn't get stolen. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Hi.~\n\n~Hi. ~But does it get used for training data? Or as training data? So, in general, the [00:16:00] rule that I have is if it is Okay. proprietary, and you're worried about sharing it, don't share it. ~Like that is just standard. ~The other way to do it is~ which screen can you see my slide deck? Is that the screen you can see this?~\n\n~Yeah. If I did~\n\n~so so if I open terminal, I went,~\n\n~ so this now~ [00:16:10] 2 \n\nbut it's just text based at this point. I can have a UI, but, and again, but it's not, again, as powerful as some of the, [00:16:20] some of the models that are out there.\n\nSo I would use an internal model like this if you're worried about proprietary stuff. That doesn't go [00:16:30] anywhere, then this stays on your computer in here and doesn't go anywhere. And by the way, this you can use on a plane without internet as well. So [00:16:40] this is intelligence on your laptop that you don't need any chat GPT account or cloud account or any, you don't have to pay for anything on this.\n\n[00:16:50] Right. And you can still say, write me an article on Penguins, and it'll still [00:17:00] do what a chat GPD would do, but on your laptop. Okay. Well, that's right.\n\n[00:17:10] What I'd love to show you is Gary's book, day trading attention has got this. Flow chart, it is how you create [00:17:20] cohorts and then strategic organic content, depending on your platforms and pack and and how you amplify that ~and ~and how you, you make it better. So, [00:17:30] based on that if you use IMX, who helps why achieve Zed ~in, in, in, in your, in the slides, there's this training notes.~\n\n~If you go, I don't know whether I have enough time. Julia, do I have enough time to go? Was it a hard stop in three minutes? ~\n\nAstha Avinash: ~Hard stop. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Okay. Sorry. So, that's cool. In,~ in your slide deck that you have access, you'll see training notes. If you click on training [00:17:40] notes, you'll open a link that will show you the exact method that I did for the first crew on the video and how to use [00:17:50] the cohorts.\n\nSo, you start with IMX who helps Y achieve Zed, and then you run this first prompt. And it'll give you it'll give [00:18:00] you your audience and then you run your user persona and then you run this prompt and it'll give you your whole cohorts, all the cohorts that you need for day [00:18:10] trading attention. So, what would have normally taken you, I don't know a few hours to read the book, a few more hours to understand and apply it to your [00:18:20] business.\n\nNow, in about three or four minutes, you have the whole thing applied. Just following the steps and you can take it one step further [00:18:30] and inside Amplify AI's, I'm going to give you access to this as well. This will just ask you [00:18:40] seven questions. You don't even have, you don't have to do the prompts. So you'll just ask you seven questions.\n\nLike what industry are you in? What's the target audience? What's your business [00:18:50] goals? And it'll create your whole strategy. This is one that's done earlier and it just kind of made the whole thing. [00:19:00] So it creates the cohorts, it does and then you can go on ~and, and, and, and, and,~ and sort of improve from here.\n\nBut what I'm trying to get at is, you can take something that already works, [00:19:10] that takes a long time to implement, and you can simplify it to take minutes. So something that would normally have taken weeks or [00:19:20] days to implement can now can be done really, really quickly. You'll have access to this deck, so I would encourage you to go through it.\n\nIn [00:19:30] here, ~if you, ~if you also click on this link here about learning anything at speed, it'll, it, it shows you how to, how I've created an AI that will, [00:19:40] will actually teach you anything. So you can say, I want to learn how to sell on a webinar in the next. 20 minutes, or I want to learn to [00:19:50] run five K's in the next three months.\n\nIt doesn't matter what it is. It'll take it and break it down and give you the exact steps for you to execute. ~Julia has access to this. I'm sure, I'm sure she's going to give you, give you access to the deck. So just click on the links. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to to to reach out.~\n\nAndrea Sullivan: This [00:20:00] is amazing. Thank you. Ronsley. The fact that you embed all of your decks with additional information. I mean, this was clearly a lot for us to take in, but we, I think we, everybody got. Some, [00:20:10] you know, practical ideas, but it'll be good to, you know, kind of encourage everyone as homework to go and yeah, figure out like, how, what are the kinds of things that you're looking to solve for?\n\n[00:20:20] And you know, we can, we'd love to, you know, bring everybody back together and hear a little bit more about what are they learning? Where are they stuck? That kind of thing. And Ron's Lisa, you know, he's great because he's an [00:20:30] entrepreneur and he understands exactly what he was talking about moving from solopreneur to.\n\nYou know, kind of expanding out and bringing teams in. He's an expert at helping people to [00:20:40] figure out how people can bring AI into their, all their operating procedures and things. So please feel free to, you know, to reach out to him [00:20:50] as a, as a a VIVE alumni. Thank you, Ronsley. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Of course. You're welcome.\n\nThank you. Ronsley, \n\nAndrea Sullivan: you're amazing. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Thank you. \n\nAndrea Sullivan: We appreciate your staying [00:21:00] up so late. Our love to your to the fam. \n\nRonsley Vaz: I will. Thank you. ~Fantastic. ~\n\nAstha Avinash: ~We're gonna hop on. ~\n\nAndrea Sullivan: ~All right, everybody. We'll hop on to the, the superpower session with Priya. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~All right. See you team. Good to see you. ~\n\nAndrea Sullivan: ~Thanks.~"

    "transcript": "AAI 132\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] everyone's focused on AI and they're looking at, and everyone's reporting as well on ai, they're feeling like they have to implement the newest and greater stuff. But ~at the, at,~ at the end of the day, for the people that we [00:00:10] serve, ~Charlie in particular, ~all we should be caring about is ~how quickly we, or how,~ how more accurately and more effectively and more efficiently can we deliver the promise.\n\nWe are making on our websites. So we're saying that [00:00:20] we deliver X, y, and z and transformation to these kind of people. Then are we using the data information and ~the two?~ The school system is a great example of that, right? So we're still sending our kids to school to [00:00:30] study something ~that,~ that we know is outdated because we don't have a better option.\n\nAnd~ everyone's ignoring that fact that first of all, especially in the states schools are more unsafe than they've ever been.~ They're not really teaching them much. And you know, you're actually sending your kid [00:00:40] to school and with the hope that they'll come back home and they'll come back smarter.\n\nBut, you know, you can get that smartness of what we thought was smart for, you know, less than $20 a month. [00:00:50] So there's a lot changing, and I think it's key to. To probably set a foundation here and say, ~well, what,~ what's the goal? And for me, I feel like [00:01:00] for us entrepreneurs, ~ ~we got into entrepreneurship to solve meaningful problems.\n\nSo if we are saying that we're gonna solve this meaningful problem, and this is the outcome we're delivering are [00:01:10] we doing everything we can to deliver that outcome~ better effectively~ more effectively, more efficiently, more ethically? Quicker, faster. ~Are you, are we solving for the last person? Because not long ago the, the statement was, well, they're just not my client. Or they just don't get what we're doing. And now you can solve for that person as well if you've taken already taken them on as a client ~if you look at [00:01:20] entrepreneurship as in general, ~the biggest jump is going from solopreneur to entrepreneur. ~~Because from solopreneur to entrepreneur, you bring all these extra elements into it, like operations and culture and process and so many elements of recruitment that come into play that a solopreneur is not really trained on yet.~\n\n~So ~the same goes with AI and the biggest jump from solopreneur to entrepreneurs because we cannot adequately, I. [00:01:30] Express what's in our heads to this new person, whoever, you know, the first person we hire, the second person we hire, we kind of have this ~ ~idea that they should know these things. [00:01:40] So there's this gap or this alignment, it's called the value alignment problem. It's the same thing happens with ai. even for the people that are good at delivery and not good at attracting, convert, have ~been.~ Being exposed to the bro [00:01:50] marketers is a huge advantage because you can now execute that at speed ~ ~being the person you are in terms of being focused on delivery, because you can actually get [00:02:00] some of the tactics that they're using and you know what? AI can help with everything from track to convert, to deliver, to scale to operations, [00:02:10] to recruitment, communication. \n\nIt it just up to you to decide or to actually stop and think ~where,~ what's held my business back all this time. [00:02:20] Where can I go with AI to actually, ~you know, ~go past that point that ~I,~ I've not been able to do before for all those people that are going well, there's~ so many, many ~multiple views of the [00:02:30] universe.\n\nPossible. And if I use ai, there's ~all,~ all those possibilities open up and it could potentially, you know, stop people from executing. [00:02:40] I have a different way of looking at it. ~If Charlie,~ if you like a cup of coffee made in a certain way ~ ~and you know, we both have different views of the world. ~And I said,~ and you said to me, Hey Ron, can you make me a cup of [00:02:50] coffee?\n\nThe chances of you getting a cup of coffee is very small the way you like it. But if you say to me, Hey, Ronsley, can I get a cup of coffee? And I'll like, it made like this, do [00:03:00] step 1, 2, 3. The chances of you getting the cup of coffee the way you like it is very, very high. ~ ~So use AI like that. ~You've, you know,~ if you've been in business ~for,~ for a decade you've got [00:03:10] processes that already work. \n\nBuild on those processes, and if you are asking AI to do something, don't give it free reign because just like you and I coming together, talk [00:03:20] about anything, we've got all these ~viewing,~ different viewing points. But if you already have data on what works for your clients, what works for bringing, ~you know,~ leads into your business, what works [00:03:30] for delivering to the clients that pay the money or getting the transformation that you're saying that you wanna deliver to them?\n\nIf you already know those things, then. [00:03:40] Use AI and give it the process rather than asking AI to come up with its own. So there's a, ~there's a, a~ distinction there. it comes down to focusing on. What [00:03:50] you don't know and what you don't have versus what you already know and what you already have. And ~ ~the tendency is to stand on this mountain of value and look at the next mountain and go, wow, [00:04:00] that's really cool. And then you get off this mountain and start climbing a new mountain all over again.\n\nAnd it feels really hard rather than, you know, really like going, oh, I've got all [00:04:10] this value. I already know this. I don't have to start again. I don't have to get off this mountain. I just have to start climbing from where I am already and, ~and I'll get,~ I'll get even better results rather than [00:04:20] getting off this height and starting all over again.\n\nSo this is coming back all the way ~to the first question that you asked me~ about if we feel like we're getting left behind with the AI and everything changing, I suppose, ~and I, I,~ [00:04:30] I don't think that business owners should be focusing on how quickly AI is changing. I think they should be focusing on. ~ The, the,~ the business goals that they have [00:04:40] and how can they get that result?\n\nAnd you can get that result without the new technology that's coming out. Much, much better than ~than ~you can trying to figure out a [00:04:50] new technology.~ if you expect that your clients to hire an expert to help them get where they want to go, then do the same. Like, I promise you,~ if you are just learning ai, there's so much you don't know. ~Like if you've just gotten into what I'm talking about when I just got, I'm talking about the last two years, two and a half years.~\n\n~If, if you are just there and you're still. You know, with prompts and all this kind, like, I, I, I, I feel like there's an element of, to you, to you, what you were saying earlier that I don't know all this stuff. And~ I meet people every week, ~Charlie,~ who say, ~you know,~ Ronsley, I am really good with ai. ~ ~[00:05:00] And then five minutes later they're like, oh, I didn't even know you could do that.\n\nAnd I'm like, that's basic. That's basic. Like, that is such a, that's fundamental to how AI [00:05:10] operates. So how are you going out and claiming AI expertise when you don't know these fundamentals? ~So there, there's,~ so, you know, if someone's looking to kind of get. Use AI [00:05:20] properly. I think getting someone who knows what they're doing and how it actually works to use it in context of where they are in business.\n\nAnd that's gonna make a huge difference just in general, just [00:05:30] straight away, rather than you having to find out what prompts are working and, ~and ~it's definitely not about the prompts, it's more about ~the,~ the process or the process of how you get the [00:05:40] result. That's why if you say, this is the framework, I'd like you to apply. \n\nYou get a way better result 'cause it knows what you're trying to achieve. ~ ~So ~maybe you can tell me~ what are you seeing with your clients and [00:05:50] where you think they need most help when it comes to execution. And~ maybe we can chat about what,~ what are ways that AI could help them get there? you know, In business ~that~ I feel we get wrong [00:06:00] is we allow AI to even disrupt our thinking of what focus looks like. ~ ~And I'm asking everyone to not do that. I'm asking [00:06:10] everyone, you already have your focus and ~stick.~ Stick with your focus. Because as a leader, the only thing that you can potentially give everyone is focus.\n\n[00:06:20] Better than anything else, and give them that focus. And then you can up that focus by allowing them to do things that only you could potentially do with [00:06:30] ai. ~So the,~ the best way to get more profitable, more efficient, more quicker, more with where you're at right now to train your people on how to use AI in a way that they can do their job [00:06:40] better. Because if you are saying that you really care about your people. ~ ~Then it shouldn't necessarily be how profitable is the goal. It should be, could I give ~my ~my team a four day work week? ~ ~[00:06:50] Could I train them with ai that they could do all their tasks better, quicker, faster, and could take a day off, ~right?~\n\nBecause in general, leaders say we care about our people, but [00:07:00] the actions don't really align ~with with with,~ with the words. So. I feel like rather than complicating the future, let's go for the future that you [00:07:10] already have and make everyone aware of what that goal is. Because ~if,~ if you don't know what winning looks like, ~ ~no amount of strategy is gonna help because you are always not gonna win.\n\n[00:07:20] 'cause it's always a moving target. ~ And, and then you,~ and then once you have your target and you know where your focus is. Empower everyone to be competent and you can today because [00:07:30] you know, AI can just be your sidekick. you know~ how~ we are still treating human resources like. ~Like ~when the industrial revolution, ~ ~you know, we are still ~ ~kind of going, ~if, if, ~if we give them [00:07:40] ai, ~ ~they could get lazy and could not be productive. But what we're giving them AI ~ ~so that they can have a better life.\n\nSo they can be more human, not be more machine like. [00:07:50] So. The industrial revolution happened and allowed us to have industry. So because of that, it allowed us to do the same things over and over again. And then we expected [00:08:00] humans to do that because you know, we're still developing the machines and now the machines have gotten smart enough that it can do these repetitive work. talking about the [00:08:10] CEOs that are kind of worried about replacement, ~ the CEOs or.~ The roles that will get ~re ~replaced~ are the, ~are the CEOs or the leaders who don't do these three things. They don't have courage, [00:08:20] they don't have connection, and they don't have collaboration. 'cause everything else can be done, everything else can be done by the machines.\n\n~And if you all, if, if, so you,~ also said at the start ~of this interview~ about how everyone's looking at content or [00:08:30] marketing as ~using as~ a use case for ai. ~ ~That's because ~they're not, ~they're trying. To sweep under the rug the thing that ~they,~ they don't wanna do, ~which is, which is,~ which is need for them to be [00:08:40] brave.\n\n~They don't wanna have, they, they want,~ they don't wanna put themselves in a position that courage is required. So let's hide behind something else and let's use AI as a distraction and [00:08:50] start talking about all the new things that are coming up with ai. ~Rather than that, ~ allow your team ~ ~to. \n\nDo things themselves rather than rely on you. So instead of you kind of going, [00:09:00] oh, ~let,~ let me take over. ~ ~In those instances right now with ai, you have such a great opportunity to say, well, why don't you look at different options and come back to me? [00:09:10] There's no better time to right now. Ask your ~your ~people to be better leaders and empower them to be better leaders.\n\nAnd as a result, by the way, it's not about like. Telling them it's more about you showing [00:09:20] them~ what it,~ what it takes. And I think it starts with ~ ~reality, which is, you know, AI is not going away I think in general, when it comes [00:09:30] to leaders and the people that report to the leaders a perspective shift is really important.\n\nAnd then a shift in. ~In ~application of how you get the same [00:09:40] results. I mean, you were talking about ~us doing your ~podcast. ~You know, ~we've been doing podcasts for like 13 years now, probably longer. ~This is about 14th year. There was a time that Charlie,~ we had seven full-time transcribers on our [00:09:50] team, and we had 14 content writers.\n\n~Right~ now we have zero transcribers because over in the last. Yeah, we've got an AI [00:10:00] transcribers that are really good ~and,~ and as of this month we are not even paying for transcription anymore because it's freely available. If you think about, if [00:10:10] your, ~if your~ job title at one point was transcriber, that really doesn't exist anymore, things are gonna change and I don't want to~ you know,~ put like [00:10:20] this nice veil over things and~ expect and, and ~say that it's not, ~it, it is changing.~ It's changing very quickly, and it's primarily because you can get the result faster, quicker, better. ~ ~So ~ ~why not use that? ~Like,~ why [00:10:30] not Like, really ~ ~make that the focus and then ~give,~ empower your people who report to you. Allow them to focus on that same outcome, because ~then ~if they're focusing on that [00:10:40] outcome, you are allowed to focus on vision. You are allowed to focus on other things that are really make you, ~ you know, the~ the person to lead. the key to using AI really [00:10:50] well as a leader is to see inside us, look at what's stopping us. Look at what our limitations are I'm talking from experience. ~ ~I've put out [00:11:00] over 1500 podcasts over the last 15 years, and in the middle of last year, I think it was in August or something, ~ ~Gary said to me straight up, he's like, dude, you're not, ~you're not~ putting ~enough~ out enough [00:11:10] content. I'm like, what? What an accusation to make. Are you kidding me? ~but then if I sat with it long, long enough,~ what I did as a result of that was I [00:11:20] decided internally that I was gonna become a student of attention for the next three years. Was my goal. So I knew that I was gonna become a student of attention and I was [00:11:30] not gonna abdicate that to Facebook ad experts, to content people, to reels people to all these other people that I have been doing in the past. For [00:11:40] example, I get more messages now that my content is authentic than I've ever gotten, ~and I am,~ and I have to break news to them to say, I, it took me 15 seconds and AI [00:11:50] wrote a lot of this.\n\nBut it's true. ~It it, I mean,~ I just wanna be honest that ~ ~it can write. ~ ~So much better than I can write. my weakness was there where I, you know, would abdicate that [00:12:00] to a content writer, which I've taken back. ~ ~And not only have I taken back, I have taken back, created a process and an ai. To then empower my team [00:12:10] to write the way I want it to be written in my voice, in my style, in my X, Y, Z. The second thing I've done is I've always abdicated Facebook ads to others and spent thousands ~and thousands~ of [00:12:20] dollars ~of on that.~\n\nSo I was like, let me take that back as well. Let's not be afraid of Facebook ads ley. So I paid a Facebook ad expert like 500 bucks an hour, and I'm like, ~ Jamie,~ teach me [00:12:30] everything you know. ~ ~And ~she ~taught me all the basics and I used AI to apply a lot of the basics. And now we're getting leads. This is all me, by the way.\n\nThere's no Facebook ~ ~[00:12:40] ad company. This is all ronsley. And to ~take that back or to ~take that over, I, I was scared because what if I try again [00:12:50] myself and fail, I have to abdicate again to someone else.\n\nBut with ai, I could plug all these gaps and I could figure it out, and I could understand and I [00:13:00] could learn. ~ ~So now I have no problem in giving it to someone and tell 'em exactly how I want it and, ~and ~how to achieve it."

    "transcript": "133 Other AIs you didn't know about\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Morning Shafiq. Can you hear me?~\n\n~Nabi Morning. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, I was trying to finish up a call. Oh, all good. It's just us so let's play the three of us. the three of us. Well, maybe more people are going to join. Let's be optimistic. Yeah, be very optimistic. I either way, it's you're the one who gets up at five o'clock in the morning.~\n\n~Ah, what's sleeping in 4 4 o'clock. Come on, get up. I know, I know. I'm, I'm I wake up at four. I, I have been waking up at 3 59 for like 12, 13 years now. Actually, my first business, it was my first business after my first business shot overnight. And I had like a whole bunch of debt. I read a book, I can't remember which book I, I, I know which book it was called.~\n\n~It was called the Miracle Morning by. Hall Ro I think probably. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember, I remember having all these debt collectors and people for coming for the car and the, and the, and the house and all this kind of stuff. And I was reading this book, and in the book he says something to the effect of if you want, if you want results other people don't get, and you gotta do things that other people don't do.~\n\n~And so, you know, it's just been a habit now since that time that I've just been waking up early and it's been a habit. However, I think in Brisbane it's easier because everyone in Brisbane wakes up earlier. It's like a Queenslander thing maybe. I don't know. The sun. The sun, the sun comes up earlier in Brisbane.~\n\n~I don't know. In India it's very different. The sun doesn't come up earlier in Brisbane, it comes up earlier in Melbourne. So I'm up at four o'clock here. When you are getting up at four o'clock or or whatever there, it's already five o'clock. I've already done. Now's work. It's a daylight savings, isn't it?~\n\n~Yeah. Yeah. Which will end in a couple of weeks, unfortunately or fortunately, I noticed that when I was working that by about quarter past five, it was getting light and I thought, oh, this is great. And of course now it's getting closer to like seven o'clock before it starts getting light, which is a shame.~\n\n~Yeah, I think that's so I, I actually really miss Brisbane 'cause of that 'cause I feel my body clock really light that, you know, early to bed, sort of early to rise sort of thing. Here in, in India it's the exact opposite. Everyone's late to bed. Late to rise. Yeah, right. So yeah, it is. So people eat later here.~\n\n~Like I, I, I, I remember sharing a sunset with, with, with my dinner and everyone made fun of me, and they're like, who eats dinner at six 30? Like fucking everyone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Well, I mean, we have a dinner at six, but yeah, it's it's different here. And it's even more later in Dubai. In fact, actually Dubai is even, I don't know why they, they do that.~\n\n~It's I think it de it depends. I think I, I, in Spain or in Greece? In the Mediterranean, they also do later dinners. And here, here in in India, the, the biggest meal is lunch in in, in Australia, you know, it's breakfast and dinner are big meals. Like, you know, lunch is a smaller meal. It's interesting, it's just.~\n\n~It's different, I think. Mm-hmm. So why is it, why is it only just us this morning? Where is everyone? Hmm. No idea. Maybe, maybe 'cause I momentum might might've I might've gone down a bit, but I was in the uk, which was Mm, which was, which was great for a speaking thing, but also I went to to watch a, a Liverpool game for the first time at Anfield.~\n\n~So that was, that was another dream come true. Tick in the box. Anyway. ~~Hello everyone. Scott, Catherine, Shafi. Nabi. Thank you for keeping me company. I, maybe today I kind of just want to talk about different, models that maybe, you know, we don't know about or haven't been using.~~ ~[00:00:00] anyone ~else?~\n\n~Any, any other ones that y'all are using that, uh,~ you'd like to talk about and you're getting good results with? Yep. I'm, I'm loving notebook, lm dropping everything into there. Like you can drop in 50 sources and then start getting [00:00:10] the notes the suggestions and everything, running the podcast from it.\n\nThen I take the podcast and I feed that in the chat, GPT and I say, tell me all the negatives so that I can [00:00:20] take those negatives and then turn them into positives. So ~it,~ I gave it my website and it said, oh, look, can you believe all this stuff, yada, yada, yada. And he makes these, you know, [00:00:30] promises and things like that.\n\nAnd I thought, well, if this is whatever you want to call 'em the intelligence pulling it apart like that, then what are real humans thinking. [00:00:40] So I'm taking what the intelligence is saying using their negatives to create positives. ~And then, and, and then what are you doing with that Nabi?~\n\n~Are, are you, are you releasing a podcast in a different way from Notebook lm Once it does, once it does the, the two voices. No. Well, what I've gotta do is go back into the website or whatever I've given them like, it, it might be a book. 'cause I've got a website for each of my books. So it's come out with all the different things and I've got all these different things that I've fed to it~ and everything that's come out with negatives.\n\nI, I go [00:00:50] back in and I change them so that they become positives on a website. So that if I did get~ the,~ the podcasters to go back in it would generate a fully [00:01:00] positive podcast and then send that podcast out to people saying, look, you know, it's not me. Here's a couple of podcasters and what they've done on my site.\n\n~So, who else here is doing, has got a regular podcast on and how often, how regular is your podcast, NABI? I don't have a podcast. Oh, sorry. I un I didn't un I, I, I, I understood that you have a regular podcast. No, no, no. It's the podcast that they're creating from the information that's fed into notebook lm.~\n\n~Right, but you're not that, that that audio is not going anywhere? No. Although I have taken it and sent it to people saying, look, it's not me. Here's some people who are totally independent and what they've thought of, ah, my site, yada, yada. But I'll take the negatives from those and I'll turn them into positives.~\n\n~I see, I see, I see, I see. ~I see. But feeding it into chat, GPT [00:01:10] and saying, ~give me, here's,~ here's the transcription of the podcast. 'cause they generally run between nine to 14 minutes. In the transcription ~take,~ give me all of the negatives and [00:01:20] now let's turn them into positives. Amazing. Okay. Cool. Anyone else is using something different? I'm using gamma. ~Gamma Scott. Yeah, yeah. Just for,~ just for presentations. And I'm also [00:01:30] using something called Mavic, and it's for marketing. ~So it, it really,~ because~ I'm a,~ I'm a nerd. I really haven't had the background with the business marketing sales. And [00:01:40] so I've used ~Maverick,~ Maverick and some~ some ~other stuff in Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi's ~mind ~mastermind group an AI called Gigi.[00:01:50] \n\nAnd I've been using it from my branding and from my business persona avatars. How do you spell that? Mavic? It's M-A-V-I-C ai. So there's a lot of [00:02:00] apps now that are embedding. AI in them. So we're probably all using more AI than we know. And that's why it's even more important to have your voice and writing style.\n\nSo it's [00:02:10] like, it differentiates. So you're paying for Mavic?\n\nYeah, I just bought it. Well, I, ~I ~use App Sumo for my Calendly equivalent. It's a one time payment. So I [00:02:20] was on their just 'cause I'm on their mailing list and I saw this medic and I thought, oh, interesting. I'll, ~I'll I'll~ burn a hundred bucks and see if it's got any merit. And it's, so far it's been okay.\n\nNot great, [00:02:30] you know? But Okay. So that's a one-time fee that, ~that ~they were selling through AppSumo. Yeah, I gotta say this Rony, I, I can't help but compliment you every time [00:02:40] we get on these damn calls, but and I, I know you're humble so you can handle it, but that one session that you did with [00:02:50] getting our our voice from our writing where you basically had us, you know, submit five pieces of writing.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've used that [00:03:00] again and again and again. It's just paying me huge dividends because I'll take all the writing from all these different apps and I'll just run it through that Scott Voice [00:03:10] and it, ~it's,~ people have said, wow, you know, this, this is so you, and it's, no, it's actually part of me, part of it's chat.\n\nGPT. Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate it because [00:03:20] I. ~I, I~ find that you know, for the last two and a half years, people like are using AI without doing it the right way. ~And,~ and actually even worse, people [00:03:30] are selling that to others. And the ones who don't know any better just are sort of buying.\n\nI mean, Mavic is~ is ~a great example in the sense that if you look at their price point [00:03:40] and how things are structured, I mean, ~it's,~ it is a common trend if you look at how software is being released these days. ~Mm-hmm.~ So it's very use case specific. Now, Mavic is a great example. ~It's specific use case ~[00:03:50] for branding.\n\nSo I think they're targeting obviously small to medium, you know, businesses especially solopreneurs maybe entrepreneurs who [00:04:00] are dealing with different. We might have a bunch of clients and they want different brands for those clients. And they have you know, $79 a month, forty nine, a [00:04:10] hundred forty $9 a month, $49 a month you know, plus brand workspace.\n\n~So there's,~ there's obviously a recurring income that's coming. ~Yeah. MAV iic.ai. And then,~ and then they go to something like a product [00:04:20] hunt or, you know, abum ~or, or, or those,~ and then it gets the word out to many people. And then there are,~ there are~ obviously people who in general are getting caught [00:04:30] with the whole AI coming up with new things all the time and trying to keep up so they're, -yes.\n\nYou know, subscribed to all these newsletters. And as a result, [00:04:40] every time something new comes up, they're like, oh, I've gotta keep ahead. So they. You know what, if this is the best deal right now, and then they go and buy it. And almost always ~there's, there's,~ there's some [00:04:50] great posts inside the school community of people who've used like other apps that have not really been up to par.\n\nBut they've seen the advertising come up all the [00:05:00] time and they're going, alright, I might as well just spend $59, $79, a hundred, whatever. ~And ~but if you just understand the basics and the principles around it, you can use that on any [00:05:10] LLM really. And, ~and ~that's what they're doing. ~So that, that's,~ yeah.\n\nI find myself there often I'll look at stuff like this, you know, and social is full of it. [00:05:20] Full of it, literally ~full of it.~ But, you know, I just keep going back to the LLMs and think, well, you know, if you know what you're doing. You can probably get as [00:05:30] good if not much better results if you, ~if you~ do the work of what you're trying to do is, ~is ~educate, ~you know, and I, I,~ you know, I'm old enough, long enough in the tooth that I remember the internet, you know, coming [00:05:40] on board and I, everybody said, oh, I, I don't understand it.\n\nI don't wanna learn it. And it's like, you will, ~it,~ it's gonna become baked into your day-to-day routine. And so [00:05:50] is this, so just, ~you know,~ stop making excuses, ~you know,~ get on board with a mentor somebody like yourself, ronsley and, ~and ~start learning because this is pervasive . [00:06:00] It's, ~it's ~going to be everywhere.\n\nYeah. I mean, it's already everywhere. I mean, like you just mentioned at the start, you know, everyone's, it's everywhere. Using it in some form or the other. And what's really [00:06:10] interesting is some people are still trying to hide the fact that they're using it. Yeah. ~It's it's, it's, yeah, it's hilarious.~\n\n~So obviously there's this, you know, ~I think~ e you know, when, when social,~ when Facebook first came out, everyone thought that, ~that that's~ what social [00:06:20] was. Facebook was social. So as soon as they got a Facebook account started posting and they understood little bits, and they were like, Hey, I'm a, ~I'm a~ social media expert.\n\nAnd then they [00:06:30] started to sell their services as a social media expert because they knew how to, you know, post and, ~and ~create stuff on Facebook. Similar stuff is happening right now with AI and everyone that has a chat [00:06:40] GPT account is, ~is ~claiming AI expertise. And don't get me wrong, chat, GPT is like amazing ~as a, as a.~\n\nAs an umbrella of an LLM that does a lot of [00:06:50] things and can serve a lot of people and can do all these different use cases. 'cause it's got so many different things that we can do, but it's definitely not the only one. And if [00:07:00] you've attended any of my stuff, you know, that I'm a huge fan of Claude, especially for writing.\n\nIt's like night and day, ~um~ In terms of posts and copy and [00:07:10] articles and emails and, ~and ~that kind of stuff. For sure. Also, if you do any sort of coding clause 3.7 sonnet is, [00:07:20] well, it's just, you know, for someone who's gone through so many years of learning how to code, it just feels, so easy.\n\nRight. You know, ~to like,~ to get something up and [00:07:30] running. Because the biggest problem, even for someone that, that's a very, and I'm not a great software developer because there are people who. You know, do this day and day out. ~I, I just~ I know the basics and the [00:07:40] principles and I can code, and I've done stuff, but, ~you know,~ there are still people more competent than me.\n\nAnd, ~and ~the biggest gap was running into an issue, like, especially if [00:07:50] your code compiled, there were no errors, but it didn't respond the way you wanted it to respond. You're like, oh, I don't even know where to start looking to fix this problem. So now with [00:08:00] ai, that's such a gap that's just, you know, gone.\n\nAnd if you use cursor and know how to use cursor at all, and you don't have [00:08:10] to actually learn how to use cursor, but ~it is,~ it's ridiculous. Like ~all you need is even,~ you probably just need the basic building blocks ~of, of the,~ of the file structure. Then ~you, you know,~ let cursor [00:08:20] go, go crazy on it and it'll write all your code as well automatically.\n\nAnd if you watch this in action, it's kind of really, really crazy. Like it's just doing, so [00:08:30] you can say, Hey, ~I want,~ I want to build a to-do list app. And then it'll create the file structure of what a to-do list app will look like, like the backend, the front end and all that stuff. And ~then, then you, and~ you say, okay, [00:08:40] this looks about right.\n\nAnd then it'll go in and write all the code inside those files, which is absolutely crazy. So you just have to say, ~I, you know, I wanted,~ I wanted to do this, and it'll just write all the [00:08:50] dependencies and everything. So software development has become absolutely crazy. So today I want to just cover some of the things that, you know I've been seeing the different ones that I've been seeing, [00:09:00] obviously Mavic.~ but I can't say I'm a, I'm an authority on call yet. Oh yeah.~ Deeps seek, ~I'll deeps seek~ is good if you just see how ~the,~ the tone has changed around. Deepsea is crazy. Initially it was all, ~all~ the Chinese company and now everyone's sort [00:09:10] of, collaborating ~with,~ with them~ in,~ in a large way.\n\n~I just signed up for, I just signed up for Manness as well. But I haven't Yeah. Really kicked the tires on it yet. Yeah, you'll have to get, wait for an invite. I, I've got the invite I, I'm in and they actually accepted me really quickly. I was surprised, but but I just haven't had the bandwidth to be able to get, get in there and, you know, spend three, four hours trying to figure out the, the, the environment.~\n\n~Amazing. Well, if you, if you are already in and, and you got an, you can get an invite, can you send me one. Yeah. Okay. And I think that if you go on to Discord, you can get in there pretty quick too, but yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll scrape up something for you and maybe I'll leave them post it in the school group too, so people can Yeah.~\n\n~At least be aware. Yeah, that's, that's that's great.~ Nabi ~which one,~ which is the one that you mentioned at the start notebook, lm, ~ah, notebook. Yes, that's right. Notebook.~\n\n~So, but if you, if you didn't know this, these really good ones, ~ I think there are a couple of places I, I'd love you to start to [00:09:20] know where to look for other LLMs gr GRO q.com. For sure. ~I haven't played with that yet. ~ really good, really fast. And, the reason it's fast is because it uses [00:09:30] LPU rather than GPUs.\n\nAnd and you can use a whole bunch of different, ~different ~models. It's showing you here the difference in speed output and it is really [00:09:40] fast. But here, once you sign up and it's free to just sign in, you could use all of deep seek, you could use Google's, Gemma all of Meta's different [00:09:50] models, menstrual and mixed mixture are really good models that are, ~that are ~uncensored, that are good to use.\n\nAnd obviously there's new ones from, ~from ~Alibaba, which are Quin. So. Not only is it [00:10:00] free, but you can access a whole bunch of different models that are already in here straight off the bat. And, ~and ~again, it's pretty fast. What is a really good resource [00:10:10] for everyone here is actually most places now have~ have~ these documentation on how to prompt better.\n\nSo under Grok Cloud, there's a prompting [00:10:20] guide,~ which I'll put in the chat.~\n\nAnd perplexity is another good one as well. And to get all that together, you could go do a po. So I, I have po and when you run everything through [00:10:30] PO you'll find gr just blitzes everything. And some are crazy and, ~and you know,~ some are really good. But perplexity is, is a good one as well. ~Yeah.~\n\n~Plexity po. There is I just remembered it. I forgot. How do you spell po? P-O-E-P-O-E-P-O-H. P-O-A-E-E? No, just o O. Yeah. Po like Edward Allen Poe. Edgar Allen Poll. That's the one? Yep. Okay, cool. Poll is ~Copilot\n\n[00:10:40] and ronsley. I just got onto a newsletter. They send out daily. It's called Rundown, and it's a really good. You know, collection of, ~of ~AI [00:10:50] news and tips and tricks, and there's a lot of sort of late and breaking information about stuff like perplexity. Orrock might be the king [00:11:00] today, and three days later it gets eclipsed by Manus or somebody else.\n\n~I mean, it's, you know,~ and everybody ~on this call,~ you know, we're frequent flyers that it's moving fast. Yeah. So not only are we [00:11:10] drinking from a fire hose, but it's ~ It's,~ everything's changing. That's coming outta that damn fire hose. It's amazing. Yeah. So rundowns actually really good. ~I can, I can mention that as to well rundown.~\n\n~Is that a, it's called rundown. It's,~ it's an email distribution list that they send out I've [00:11:20] only been reading it for about a month and it's really good. And the reason they're doing newsletters is because they're getting subscribers and then they get the advertising onto it.\n\nAnd that's all that it's about. Yes. Yeah, [00:11:30] it's, it's actually a really good, so what I'd love us all to look at, not only y'all, but myself included, is look at how they are doing things. And I think we should model [00:11:40] some of that is including newsletters for our people. You know, because ~every~ actually, everyone wants to be up to date.\n\nThey want curated stuff. And with now with AI [00:11:50] Notebook, LM was, is a, ~is a~ huge one. ~You know, you can,~ you can create content, you can create content the way you want it to, and you can do it at speed and you can replicate, and you can do it o [00:12:00] over and over again. You just have to get into the habit of doing it or actually just, you know, pulling the bandaid off and, ~and, and~ putting, ~putting ~it out there.\n\nBecause I, tell this story a lot. In fact, yesterday I did a [00:12:10] podcast interview and so on, interviewed me and I said that again. I've been putting out podcasts for like 13 years now. I've easily published 1500 and more episodes in that time. [00:12:20] And last year in August or September, I was having a meeting with Gary and he told me, he was like, you're not putting out enough content.\n\nI'm like, what the fuck? Are you [00:12:30] serious? And, ~and ~every part of me wanted, ~wanted ~to defend myself and say, you know, I put out all this content, but ~I, I want, I,~ I decided to listen and I realized that I wasn't putting on enough content. I was [00:12:40] doing just enough to put out content, but not really tweaking and, ~and, and, and doing,~ doing the reps after publishing.\n\nSo it was just publishing and then forgetting, the thing that come after [00:12:50] that. So it was a real good eyeopener for me. And then, he was like, so why don't you use AI to do all the things that you feel like is so hard for [00:13:00] you to do? And I was like, oh, yeah. Like, why don't I like what's stopping me?\n\nSo then I started to do that, which has made a huge difference, not only in I. The regularity of [00:13:10] content going out, but also the consistency of content going out. And also things that I used to abdicate before, like we, you know, as a company we've spent [00:13:20] so much of money on getting Facebook ads people in and getting them to deliver leads.\n\nWe don't have to anymore. I literally have [00:13:30] stopped all that and done all the stuff myself, and I'm not even joking the leads that I've been able to get over the last, so this is~ this,~ I shouldn't be, but the email [00:13:40] list, but this is just emails over the last month and a bit, or maybe month and maybe month and a few days of people sort of, coming into the system.\n\nAnd this is [00:13:50] purely me, ~I'm not.~ There's no ad agency, there's no anyone, And so what I'm saying to everyone here is, things have stopped us in the past from putting ourselves out there, and [00:14:00] I feel, using AI to put yourself out there is like the easiest, one of the easiest things to do.\n\nOr ~if you just,~ if we can just stop and, ~and, and~ not get in our own way. So just like, ~just like ~Paul, which is also very [00:14:10] powerful there's a really good one that I highly recommend from abacus.ai called chat, LLM. And it's 10, ~10 ~bucks a month, but ~it, it got,~ it's got access to all the different models in [00:14:20] here.\n\nHowever, I have to say, both poll and chat LLM or any other LLM or ~any, ~any of these aggregator, LLMs don't give the same [00:14:30] result as if I went straight to Claude or straight to Gemini. Or straight to GPT4. And I think I could be wrong. I think that it's because [00:14:40] of the underlying system instruction. So if you notice most system instruction start with you are a helpful assistant that does X, Y, Z.\n\nSo [00:14:50] even that system instruction might be different in, ~in ~all these, that's why they probably are responding differently. So just to keep all these in mind, I mean, chat l lm, but there's one that [00:15:00] I have open here. LM arena.ai is probably the go-to place for what's ranking right now. And~ I, I don't really see, I,~ I don't want you to get caught [00:15:10] up in how quickly things are moving because I.\n\nIt's not about how quickly things are moving at all. It's about how quickly can you implement the things that you haven't been able to implement [00:15:20] in your business in the past. ~That's, that's it,~ that's the simplest that I wanted to focus on . the only reason you're aware of all this new things in AI is because [00:15:30] everyone's creating a new, ~new ~newsletter or there's new content going out and you are involved in it.\n\n~This kind of,~ these kind of breakthroughs have been happening in AI for ages. It's just that [00:15:40] no, no one's known about it. It's, it was happening in a silo. So now that everyone's on top of it, it just feels like it's happening so quickly and~ and~ don't get caught up in that. So don't get [00:15:50] caught up in ~the, the,~ the new of open AI with agents that have been released yesterday and the day before yesterday.\n\nDon't get caught up in all that kind of stuff. Don't get caught up in ~witch. ~Which model is, ~is ~[00:16:00] ranking higher. ~But go get caught up in, in, I believe~ I get caught up in this idea, you know, over the last x amount of years that I've been in business, I haven't been able to break through a certain revenue mark, or I haven't been able to [00:16:10] get consistent lead flow, or I haven't been able to deliver in the way that I want.\n\nAnd, and I haven't been able to get the, ~the the~ case studies or the testimonials the way I want them. So whatever [00:16:20] the block is, whatever ~the,~ everyone has them, it doesn't matter how long you've been in business, everyone has, ~has ~them. So, go after those, go after those thorns in your business [00:16:30] that have not allowed you to push past a certain point.\n\nSo whatever that is. So ~if, if, if it is,~ if it is content, which ~most ~it is for most people who care about delivery more than they care about [00:16:40] a truck and convert ~it,~ it usually is, you know, being, out there more. So find whichever one it is that ~that, that~ you can use, that ~that ~gets you those results.\n\n~So L Marina is, is a really good one to look at what, what, what are the different ones out there? But again, you know, you don't have to look at all of them. gotta show you some here that I think are really cool, that are, that are not lms, but lms. Because most ais now are, are LLMs. This is gly glyph app.~\n\n~And it makes some really cool stuff like, memes. And so for example, if you wanted to create say, say a meme. That looked like this. The startup kit meme about AI in business. As an example. Oh, it didn't like me.~\n\n~So I've run some of these before. Like, I also to make a, a meme around ai that's not as good as some of these. Oh yeah. So I may ask it to do a meme about ai where Open AI was complaining that Deep Seek used their models when open AI stole author's data to train their models. So it made this meme, which again, is, is really cool because even though the, some of these words might not necessarily be right, I can, you know, the team can take this meme and put it into Canva or something and edit the words out, but they don't, don't necessarily have to make the meme from scratch, and these are common memes that you can use. For example, this one got, got a lot of, got a lot of engagement on social what, what, what my friends think I do, what my parents think I do, what my boss thinks I do, what society thinks I do, what I, what I think I do, what I actually do. So you can create this all, you know, in your own field, especially if you are a real estate agent.~\n\n~You know, it, it it is like off left field a little bit, but it's still content that gets engagement because people understand irrespective of where you're at, you know, to make these kind of things. So if you had to do this on your own, it would've taken a long time. But if you go into glyph, you can pick your meme and then give it context and it'll come up with some, some really cool things like the AI consultant starter kit.~\n\n~so if someone's an AI consolidate, they totally understand, you know, let me explain how this will 10 x your ROI. It's, it's pretty funny actually. It's, it's pretty good. So, gif gly app is, is, is, is one that I've come across that I've thought is, is pretty cool. You can choose whichever one.~\n\n~You can choose memes and images and stuff like that. Replicate.com is a really nice one. It's, it's, it's, you just have to put a credit card in, but I don't really think that it's much.~\n\n~Yeah, just have a look like I view the total of 78 cents, you know, and I've generated a lot. if you're gonna explore, there's a whole bunch of different models that you can use. And so you can go and create videos, you can create different types of images.~\n\n~You can obviously generate text. There's a whole bunch of different things. Transcribed speech. Actually this is really powerful, the one in replicate.com because I've used some of the image generation in here and I think it's really, it's really great actually. I'm gonna play around. But you can see all the different things that you can do here.~\n\n~You can, create 3D stuff you can use. audio, can remove backgrounds. Obviously background in it's crazy how to remove backgrounds. Used to be, you know, such a thing that you had to pay someone in Photoshop to go and remove backgrounds that is now just a single click in, in Canva.~\n\n~So how that has changed even transcription is another example. I, I use this a lot because we've been making podcasts for people and brands and businesses for maybe 12 or 13 years now. And not long ago we had seven transcribers on our team full-time, and we had 14 content writers who don't exist anymore, which is crazy.~\n\n~So we have zero transcribers. And that that's obviously a, a, a space that is changed quite drastically. So, replicate is great. You can do a whole bunch of different things and replicate. Then spoke about Cursor. Catherine uses Leonardo. Yeah. I, I, Leonardo is good, but I highly recommend Midjourney.~\n\n~My God, the, the, the results I've been able to get in Midjourney~\n\n~are really amazing.~\n\n~Who's used Midjourney here? Anyone? Abbie? Yeah. Have you put out any of the, of your images using Midjourney or where have you used them? I do posts fairly regularly in LinkedIn. I. So, I, I come up with ideas there quite often. I'll do the post in chat GPT and say, give me a graphic that it pulls in from Dali.~\n\n~And if I'm not happy with that, then I'll pull in I'll create one in in Midjourney. And you'll, you are obviously, you got a Pro account and or you are using, is you using the free account? What, what, what are you just a free account? Oh, really? I don't do it that often. Yeah. I don't use it that often.~\n\n~I mean, I don't use that often, but I'm still paying, which makes me think that I should go and check all my subscriptions right now. But as a financial advisor, I would tell you yes, guilty, guilty. But I, I, I feel like mid journey, I've not actually come across a better image generator than, than Midjourney. Just some of the things that it makes like. Wow. I want you to think about how long it would've taken someone to get this picture if they had a mm-hmm. Higher model, you know, get the light writing get the right lighting, you know, then click all the images, then do the edits, and then finally give you this one image, how long that would take.~\n\n~And, and, and, and a lot of these in mid journey, what you can do is you can personalize to your, so you, I've got a certain style, and every time I use the minus, minus p, which is personalized to my style, that's the, that's the command in mid journey that you give to say, generate this image, but generate it in my style.~\n\n~You'll see, see, this is, this is my style. You'll notice that it's a common style. So if I put. this minus minus p it'll create to design, design me an image based on offload busy work. Whenever you think I need to remember this, let ChatGPT handle it. And it created this really, great image.~\n\n~Some of the images that it makes inside my journey are like ridonculous. And if you're not happy, you change it within five seconds. 100%. Yeah. They're really edgy too. And, and some of them are edgy and funny, you know, that's your personality. So they're, they're really good. Yeah, they're really good. and obviously the better you prompt it, the more detailed you given it in the prompt, the better it responds.~\n\n~so I actually made a t-shirt. and I wanted to put a caricature on it. And so I was designing these, caricatures, and then I landed up putting, I think this I think the one with an R on it on my T-shirt. And I thought, I thought that was insane to go for uh, this one to go from, a cartoon or from a concept to a t-shirt with a saying.~\n\n~It's like so quick and it's original, right? Mm-hmm. I don't have to like, worry about, you know, copyright that kind of stuff. So I thought actually what happened was, if you don't know who Gar Seamus is, Gar Seamus is a friend and a leg, and the legend who started ComicCon. So literally he's the guy that started ComicCon, sold ComicCon, then they didn't run it the way he wanted it to run, so he bought it back from them and then grew it into Asia and all these other places, and then sold it again and like, and with, with rules on how he wants it to run.~\n\n~And I met him when I, I I, I've met him a few times, but I, I met him the last time I met him was in Toronto when I was doing my book launch. And we were walking down the street and he was like, Hey, you know what? I would love to be able to get to a point where there's no middleman. It's just me creating comics and that's gonna be my, my, my happy place.~\n\n~So I was helping him come up with, you know, some some. Comic characters, and this was such a fun experiment. Like, look at some of these images are just wow, wow. Just blown away. So we were doing some work then, and, and it was just so cool to like try these things. So Midjourney is really good for that.~\n\n~And and you'll notice if you see this style, you'll notice that this is my personalized style. It, it just keeps re you know, you see the, the orange and the red and the, and and how it, it it represents that. I love how it does exploded views of something. So I've got this prompt that I talk about, you know, provide me an exploded view of a mobile phone.~\n\n~So what does it look, you know, when a mobile phone's exploded out and wow. Like, wow. So yeah, I mean, you know, imagination is literally your only, stopping point. It's, it's just how much you can imagine that, that you can create. So this is mid journey for images, and then I spoke about replicate as well, which I think should be in the image category, but you can do a whole bunch of different things inside that.~\n\n~Now we mentioned poll for LLMs, but then there's, there's chat LLM that you can use for that as well. So two, two of the similar ones. There's, there's Microsoft Copilot perplexity is amazing. I highly recommend Perplexity if you're doing any sort of search, and I feel that, by the way, whoever uses Perplexity will know that the perplexity search is better.~\n\n~Then the open AI search. However, the open ai, deep research is so much in depth that, you know, again, at the start of this session, I was talking about how you should use AI for all the things that were stopping you before. For me, what was stopping me was, or things that I wanted to do that I could not get, right.~\n\n~However much I delegated it. Actually, maybe I didn't delegate properly. I, you know, maybe I abdicated and that's why I didn't get it right. So, I think in entrepreneurship, the more humble you are, the quicker you learn your lessons. So for me, one of the things is, is the long form posts. So I've always wanted to build these long form posts and it's, it's, it was so hard to collate and get it right and put it together, and now it's taking.~\n\n~I would say it takes me a total of 45 minutes to create a long form post like this which would've normally taken, I don't know, days to put together collate. So not only does is it, is it a one-time thing. I've, I've created a four part series and they'll come out, you know, every week. And, and also this long form post, not only like, I can not only send it to, to a whole bunch of people and say, Hey, if you're looking for 25 ways to grow your podcast here are 25 content strategies that you should use.~\n\n~Here are 25 audience engagement strategies that you can use. And I'm, and in the next couple of weeks, you'll get 25 ways to monetize your podcast. And then there's 25 diff different distribution tactics for you to get results. But not only am I sending everyone to this one spot that. They can get all these, really good tips, but also it is creating this pillar post with links to, to my content, which are previous episodes that I've done.~\n\n~So if someone really wants to, for example, this one in particular, building audience engagement as a part one of the growth guide, and it's like, okay, here are 25. Start by actually solving problems. And then if you want more, this is a whole episode that I've done with Ed Dale, that someone can just go and click and, and so it's like not only is it creating a pillow post, it's creating an SEO worthy pillow post that now is getting linked to other content that I've already created before.~\n\n~So for me, this is very useful and very powerful for things that I've been wanting to do for ages that I've just never gotten around to doing it. Or if I've got, if we've gotten to doing it, we've paid someone money and it hasn't gotten done the way we wanted to do, so it never got out. So these are things that I'm implementing that I think that you should really look at and see how you can implement.~\n\n~Because now this post already from the SEO, from the keyword analysis that we got, the analytics that we get from Google is already ranking pretty well, and it's only been maybe a week and a bit that this post has been out. So, ~~use AI for the things that you thought at one time, Hey, I wish I could do that.~\n\n~And, now you can. If you just sort of focus, get it done, make sure you have a process to do it, and then keep repeating it before you get. To do the next process. So don't worry about the new AI tools that are coming out, rather worry about these things that you can implement and execute and then start to get results on.~\n\n~I hope, I'm trying to, I hope I'm making sense about, you know, how, how I, how I I ask, I, I'm asking you to think about using AI~\n\n~ronsley. Can I ask you a question about, about, you're on many platforms and then you're writing. So for example what you just mentioned, do you have a, a ronsley filter persona, voice? For each platform? Or did you set it up, let's say, for example, on chat, GPT and you like it the most there? So you'll take everything raw that you've created, on other platforms like Cloud, and then run it through your voice on chat, GPT.~\n\n~I'm curious about that or do you have it set up on each platform and you're happy with the results? That's a great question. So I don't really think that I'm very happy with the results that come out of chat GPT. I've never really been. Yeah, that was just hypothetical. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, I understand.~\n\n~But however much I have customized my chat, GPT or even the GPTs inside, actually I lie. Platform. So every, every LLM has a backend, like a coding backend that is very dev focused. So for chat gt, it's, it's this platform dot,~\n\n~platform dot what was it? openai.com. And inside here you can if you go in the dashboard,~\n\n~you come down to assistance. You can make assistance in here that are really good. Like I, I, I trust these outputs better than I trust the output coming out of chat GPT. Again, I think it's because of the system instructions that you know, are wrapped around chat g pt that doesn't give you the results that you want.~\n\n~This is, this is way better. So in here I've created assistance that I can call on, which are very powerful. For example, this one is the Amplify AI book. If I, if I throw any instructions at this assistant, it'll take the instructions and return back for you, where in the book I cover. Whatever I'm, I'm asking of it.~\n\n~So if, if, if you're trying to grow operations, then it'll go, oh, Ronsley has covered this in part one or part three of the book. And on this page you can go and find how to grow operations in your business. So it's a, it's an, it's a, it's an assistant that's trained on my book. Then this, here's an assistant that's trained on how I would like my mid journey prompts to be written so I can just throw anything at this and it'll return back a good midjourney prompt for me.~\n\n~And this is all in the backend. So, so rather than me creating GPTs I create these assistants in the background. So I think this is really powerful, which again, I, I totally forgot to mention that. I think I, I, if you're any, if you're technically inclined, then this is a really good place to do that.~\n\n~So, to answer your question Scott, I really like my voice. My voice is very accurate. When it comes out of Claude, I haven't found that in other LLMs. However, if I'm using a lot of data, then I, then I ask Gemini to, collate that because it can take a larger context window. Mm-hmm. And then so for example, that, that, that post that you just saw, which was, you know, the 25 ways to improve your Podcast or Grow your Podcast chat, GPT Deep Research did most of that research.~\n\n~But then the writing part of that, the introduction and the bits in between were done by Claude because that represents my voice better than what Chat GPT could. So, I think there's, there's, there's still an element of human checking involved which might not be too far away from, you know, an agent coming along and you asking the agent to check how you check for your voice.~\n\n~But until that point, I feel like us going through it ourselves and going, okay, this is how we would check it, is probably a good idea so that you can give those rules to an AI in the future.~\n\n~Wow. Thanks for lifting the covers on, you know, how you create that's really helpful for me. I. And I don't want to be greedy, but if I could just throw these out and you could maybe comment on them or defer later. But you didn't mention video, so do you have a favorite video platform these days?~\n\n~And then just a side note, 'cause I'm a bit of a, a, a crypto guy. Your comic example for any creators isn't blockchain the promise of getting rid of the middleman? And again, that can be, you know, we can do that in school in the discussions, but I'm, I just can't help but think in smart contracts, you can get rid of all the middlemen, iTunes for music and, you know, Spotify and, you know, even, even buying a house or brokering a business, you can do it with blockchain.~\n\n~I totally agree. I mean, I find the fact that they're paying bank fees an absolute joke. You know, absolute joke. And when I think about, so for some, for, for us. Our largest bill are bank fees. By, by, by, by a long shot. And I'm talking about everything. 'cause Australia charges, me money when someone pays in USD and then charges me money to convert to to from USD to a UD then it charges me money again.~\n\n~When I pay in USD out, it's a fuck. It's like I cannot stress enough how quickly I want smart contracts to come and take over. Yes, yes. I feel your pain. I'm Canadian, so, and I'm in Mexico, so you know, US dollars always factor in and we get beat, you know, and we convert one to the other. And I have begged businesses to work with, with crypto.~\n\n~It's like, pay me in blood in Bitcoin, pay me in Ethereum. You know, pay me in in anything other than fiat. And some do, some don't. But yeah, it's coming. I, I think see that's, that's the thing with change is that people don't like change and, you know, you know how many middlemen would lose their jobs if smart contracts came around.~\n\n~Yeah. Thanks Chris. Good to see you. So I agree 100%. It's just depends on how, the people in power want it to operate, I suppose. Video you mentioned asked video. Yeah, I, I think trying so is is a good idea, but runway ML is probably the leader in that pack. Okay. Yeah. Great. Alright.~\n\n~Alright, team. Really good to see you all. Thank you so much. It was great. I, I, I love hanging out with you. Thank you for, thank you all for showing up. One more question before you leave Broley. Yeah. Yep. You sent out an email about some new program that you're doing. Yes, yes. Do you wanna talk a little about it?~\n\n~Yes. So rather than doing this, the individual workshops, I wanted to put them all into a 90 day program 'cause, you know, then I could teach one after the other. And it could be, you could get the results straight away. So I'm getting really good, obviously, Shafiq, you've attended a, a couple of the workshops.~\n\n~The results at the back end of the workshops are like amazing. I love all the feedback at the workshop. And then after when everyone's sending me messages going, oh my God, this is mind blowing. So I thought, so the 90 day program is basically creating your whole marketing engine using AI that is from your lead magnets to your nurturing, to your, you know, long post that I've just showed you.~\n\n~So how can in, in nine, in 90 days, we create, you know, hands off your whole AI marketing system to attract new clients into your business. And I'm starting that exactly a month from now, roughly. So April 14th is the week that that starts. And it'll go for 12 weeks. So it'll be basically the courses that you've been doing that, that have been out of this program.~\n\n~Right. Once we've, it'll be the f follow on from those, so it'll be, so if you've done them, it's, it's even better because you've already, you already have the foundation, but it'll No, but there'll be similar in, in the way you're doing them, except it'll be structured. You do step one, then you do step two, you do step three, you do step four.~\n\n~Correct. Is that correct? Correct. Okay. Correct. Correct, correct. And, and, and I, and I'm, and. I don't know if you are in the wait list, but if, if you are in the wait list, then I think yesterday or the day before the team sent out the, the breakdown of what we're gonna cover in each week. They did. They did.~\n\n~Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. I, I wasn't sure. I, I totally understood what it was. And thank you for the clarification and Okay, cool. If the call has not done his classes, they're phenomenal. They're just, thank you. I mean, the, the depth and breadth of what he covers in an hour is amazing. Thank you. Like just your, your, your thing on creating your persona and in using Claude was just spec and I think, Scott, you were on it.~\n\n~Yeah. Yeah, I'm a huge fan. I'm, my biggest thing is, and I think Shafiq, you and, and Nabi and others on the call, you guys are at a, a, a in the evolution of your business. I think that, you know, going back to my coding days, you know, I have to write a program, it's like, well, you know, you haven't even really defined the problem you're trying to solve yet.~\n\n~So for me, I'm so early in developing my business that I don't have SOPs per se. I'm still creating, I'm still I'm building legs on the table, you know, I've got my core business. But I feel like maybe you can talk about this next week ronsley prerequisites. Where do you need to be to really capitalize on this 90 day challenge?~\n\n~And maybe I won't. Jump in this time, but I'll be better set up six months from now or a year from now. 'cause I don't wanna waste anybody's time. I don't wanna hold anybody down, you know, in terms of ballast. But you know, I look at Nabi and I'm always inspired because he's really got something good going on and, you know, obviously been doing, you know, the financial stuff for a long time.~\n\n~He's like, I fooled another one. No, but sincerely, you know, and Ron's the you too. I mean, you got, you're a subject matter expert in this and other things. And so I just want to get a little, maybe you can talk a little bit about the prerequisites if there are any next week. So I, I, I don't think there are prerequisites.~\n\n~I think the on, the only thing that I can think about is have you delivered an outcome to a bunch of people? Like who are your people? And have you delivered the transformation you promised to them? And if you have, that's all you need. Because there are different people in different parts that either have never put out content or have done not done marketing or any of that stuff.~\n\n~The thing that I care about most is, is people who have delivered an outcome and are good at what they do and are not being heard, and are not being found and are the best kept secret. So for them, this is like gold. This is gonna change everything. So if you already got clients and you feel like you don't, you're not, the lead flow is the, the bit that's stopping you.~\n\n~The 90 day program is for you easily. Like, it's just that that's a no brainer. But if you don't have a product and you've not delivered a result and you're just starting off and you, you have a, an idea of what you want to do, then it's not for you. So that's probably the best way to Yeah, to distinguish.~\n\n~Yeah. That's great. I'm trying to cut back on a heck of a lot of stuff. So I cut out all newsletters and everything like that so I can concentrate on my, on my work and stuff. And I saw that come through and I thought, oh no, I'd love to, but I can't devote the time. But how much is it? It's, it's like 1400 or 14 something for the, for the, for the 90 days.~\n\n~Right. And if you are on an early bird, you get like, oh, if you're on a waiting list, there's a discount. And the team has sorted out though. I don't get involved in this, in, in this, in the pricing anymore. It's 1497 and early bird is 500 bucks. Yeah, there you go. 500, sorry. So it's a thousand. Yeah. Nine 97,000.~\n\n~That's really reasonable. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, the idea is it's economical and not, not only economical, it's, it's about getting the result. And I know that in 90 days that you'll get the result and you'll be like, oh, the lead's coming in. There's, there's, you know, money coming in. And that's, that's what I care about.~\n\n~I don't really, you know, and I just want people serious enough to implement. So, yeah. Feel no pressure either way. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just here to serve really. And they're recorded. If we're able to attend live, right? It's all recorded. They'll, each one will have a playbook. Each one will have a playbook and a checklist and how to execute and process and prompt list and prompt packs and, and everything.~\n\n~Just like how we had the playbook for the previous ones, Shafiq that are easy to follow and yeah. Yeah. Alright, team, I've gotta jump off. Greater hangout with everyone. Yeah. Thank you for, for showing up. I'll see you next week. Cheers. Bye guys.~"

    "transcript": "p2\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] So L Marina is, ~is ~a really good one to look at ~what, what,~ what are the different ones out there? But again, you know, you don't have to look at all of them. gotta show you some here that I think are really cool, ~that are,~ that are [00:00:10] not lms, but lms. Because most ais now are, are LLMs. This is ~gly~ glyph app.\n\nAnd it makes some really cool stuff like, memes. [00:00:20] And so for example, if you wanted to create ~ say,~ say a meme. That looked like this. The startup kit meme about AI in business. As an [00:00:30] example. ~Oh, it didn't like me.~\n\nSo I've run some of these before. ~Like, I also to make a, a meme around ai that's not as good as some of these. Oh yeah.~ So I may ask it to do a meme about ai where Open AI was complaining that Deep Seek used their models when open AI stole author's [00:00:40] data to train their models. So it made this meme, which again, is, ~is ~really cool because even though the, some of these words might not necessarily be right, ~I can, you know,~ the team can [00:00:50] take this meme and put it into Canva or something and edit the words out, but they don't, don't necessarily have to make the meme from scratch, and these are common memes that [00:01:00] you can use. For example, this one ~got, got a lot of, ~got a lot of engagement on social what, ~what, what~ my friends think I do, what my parents think I do, what my boss thinks I do, what society [00:01:10] thinks I do, what I, ~what I~ think I do, what I actually do. So you can create this all, you know, in your own field, especially if you are a real estate agent.\n\n~You know, it, it~ it is like off [00:01:20] left field a little bit, but it's still content that gets engagement because people understand irrespective of where you're at, you know, to make these kind of things. So if you had to do this on your own, it would've taken a [00:01:30] long time. But if you go into glyph, you can pick your meme and then give it context and it'll come up with some, ~some ~really cool things like the AI [00:01:40] consultant starter kit.\n\nso if someone's an AI consolidate, they totally understand, you know, let me explain how this will 10 x your ROI. It's, it's pretty funny actually. It's, it's pretty good. [00:01:50] So, ~gif ~gly app is, ~is, is, is~ one that I've come across that I've thought is, is pretty cool. You can choose whichever one.\n\nYou can choose memes and images and stuff like that. Replicate.com [00:02:00] is a really nice one. ~It's, it's, it's,~ you just have to put a credit card in, but I don't really think that it's much.\n\nYeah, just have a look like I view the total of 78 cents, you know, and I've [00:02:10] generated a lot. if you're gonna explore, there's a whole bunch of different models that you can use. And so you can go and create videos, you can create different types of [00:02:20] images.\n\nYou can obviously generate text. There's a whole bunch of different things. Transcribed speech. Actually this is really powerful, the one in replicate.com because I've used [00:02:30] some of the image generation in here and I think it's really, ~it's really~ great actually. ~I'm gonna play around. ~But you can see all the different things that you can do here.\n\nYou can, create 3D stuff you can [00:02:40] use. audio, can remove backgrounds. Obviously background in it's crazy how to remove backgrounds. Used to be, you know, such a thing that you had to pay someone in Photoshop to [00:02:50] go and remove backgrounds that is now just a single click in, ~in ~Canva.\n\nSo how that has changed even transcription is another example. I, I use this [00:03:00] a lot because we've been making podcasts for people and brands and businesses for maybe 12 or 13 years now. And not long ago we had seven [00:03:10] transcribers on our team full-time, and we had 14 content writers who don't exist anymore, which is crazy.\n\nSo we have zero [00:03:20] transcribers. And ~that ~that's obviously a, ~a, a~ space that is changed quite drastically. So, replicate is great. You can do a whole bunch of different things and replicate. [00:03:30] Then ~spoke about Cursor. Catherine uses Leonardo. Yeah. I, I,~ Leonardo is good, but I highly recommend Midjourney.\n\nMy God, the, ~the, the~ results I've been able to get in Midjourney\n\nare really amazing.\n\n~Who's used Midjourney here? Anyone? Abbie? Yeah. Have you put out any of the, of your images using Midjourney or where have you used them? ~I do posts fairly regularly in [00:03:40] LinkedIn. I. So, I, I come up with ideas there quite often. I'll do the post in chat GPT and say, give me a graphic that it pulls in from Dali.\n\nAnd if I'm [00:03:50] not happy with that, then ~I'll pull in~ I'll create one in ~in ~Midjourney. And you'll, ~you are~ obviously, you got a Pro account and or you are using, is you using the free account? ~What, what, what are you~ just a free account? Oh, really? I don't do it that often. [00:04:00] Yeah. I don't use it that often.\n\nI mean, I don't use that often, but I'm still paying, which makes me think that I should go and check all my subscriptions right now. ~But~ as a financial advisor, I would tell [00:04:10] you yes, guilty, guilty. But I, I, I feel like mid journey, I've not actually come across a better image generator than, ~than~ [00:04:20] Midjourney. Just some of the things that it makes like. Wow. I want you to think about how long it would've taken someone to get this picture if they had a ~mm-hmm.~ Higher model, you [00:04:30] know, ~get the light writing ~get the right lighting, ~you know,~ then click all the images, then do the edits, and then finally give you this one image, how long that would take.\n\n~And, and, and,~ and a lot of these in mid [00:04:40] journey, what you can do is you can personalize to your, so you, I've got a certain style, and every time I use the minus, minus [00:04:50] p, which is personalized to my style, that's the, ~that's the~ command in mid journey that you give to say, generate this image, but generate it in my style.\n\nYou'll see, see, this is, ~this is~ [00:05:00] my style. You'll notice that it's a common style. So if I put. this ~minus ~minus p it'll create to design, design me an image [00:05:10] based on offload busy work. Whenever you think I need to remember this, let ChatGPT handle it. And it created this really, great image.\n\nSome of the images that it [00:05:20] makes inside my journey are like ridonculous. And if you're not happy, you change it within five seconds. 100%. Yeah. They're really edgy too. And, and some of them are edgy and funny, you know, [00:05:30] that's your personality. So they're, they're really good. Yeah, they're really good. and obviously the better you prompt it, the more detailed you given it in the prompt, the better it responds.\n\nso [00:05:40] I actually made a t-shirt. and I wanted to put a caricature on it. And so I was designing these, caricatures, and then I landed up putting, I think this I think the one with an [00:05:50] R on it on my T-shirt. And I thought, ~I thought~ that was insane to go for uh, this one to go from, a cartoon or from a concept to a t-shirt [00:06:00] with a saying.\n\nIt's like so quick and it's original, right? Mm-hmm. I don't have to like, worry about, ~you know, ~copyright that kind of stuff. ~So I thought~ actually what happened was, if you don't know who [00:06:10] Gar Seamus is, Gar Seamus is a friend and ~a leg, and~ the legend who started ComicCon. So literally he's the guy that started ComicCon, sold ComicCon, then [00:06:20] they didn't run it the way he wanted it to run, so he bought it back from them and then grew it into Asia and all these other places, and then sold it again [00:06:30] and like, and with, ~with ~rules on how he wants it to run.\n\nAnd I met him ~when I, I I, I've met him~ a few times, but I, I met him the last time I met him was in Toronto when I was doing my book launch. And we were [00:06:40] walking down the street and he was like, Hey, you know what? I would love to be able to get to a point where there's no middleman. It's just me creating comics and that's [00:06:50] gonna be my, ~my, my~ happy place.\n\nSo I was helping him come up with, you know, some~ some.~ Comic characters, and this was such a fun [00:07:00] experiment. Like, look at some of these images are just wow, wow. Just [00:07:10] blown away. So we were doing some work then, ~and,~ and it was just so cool to like try these things. So Midjourney is really good for that.\n\nAnd and you'll notice if you see this style, you'll [00:07:20] notice that this is my personalized style.~ It, it just keeps re you know,~ you see the, ~the ~orange and the red and ~the, and and~ how it, ~it it ~represents that. I love how it does exploded views of something. So I've got this prompt that I talk [00:07:30] about, you know, provide me an exploded view of a mobile phone.\n\nSo what does it look, you know, when a mobile phone's exploded out and wow. Like, wow. ~So yeah, I mean, you know,~ imagination is literally [00:07:40] your only, stopping point. It's, ~it's ~just how much you can imagine that, ~that ~you can create. So this is mid journey for images, and then I spoke about replicate as [00:07:50] well, which I think should be in the image category, but you can do a whole bunch of different things inside that.\n\nNow we mentioned poll [00:08:00] for LLMs, but then there's, ~there's~ chat LLM that you can use for that as well. So ~two,~ two of the similar ones. There's, ~there's~ Microsoft Copilot [00:08:10] perplexity is amazing. I highly recommend Perplexity if you're doing any sort of search, and I feel that, by the way, whoever uses Perplexity [00:08:20] will know that the perplexity search is better.\n\nThen the open AI search. However, the open ai, [00:08:30] deep research is so much in depth that, you know, again, at the start of this session, I was talking about how you should use [00:08:40] AI for all the things that were stopping you before. For me, what was stopping me was, or things that I wanted to do that I could not get, right.\n\nHowever much I delegated it. Actually, [00:08:50] maybe I didn't delegate properly. I, you know, maybe I abdicated and that's why I didn't get it right. So, I think in entrepreneurship, the more humble you are, the quicker you learn your lessons. [00:09:00] So for me, one of the things is, ~is ~the long form posts. So I've always wanted to build these long form posts and ~it's, it's,~ it was so hard to [00:09:10] collate and get it right and put it together, ~and now it's taking.~\n\nI would say it takes me a total of 45 minutes to create a long form post like this which would've normally taken, [00:09:20] I don't know, days to put together collate. So not only does is it, is it a one-time thing. I've, I've created a four part series and they'll come [00:09:30] out, you know, every week. And, and also this long form post, not only like, I can not only send it ~to,~ to a whole bunch of people and say, Hey, if you're [00:09:40] looking for 25 ways to grow your podcast here are 25 content strategies that you should use.\n\nHere are 25 audience engagement strategies that you can use. And I'm, and in the next couple of [00:09:50] weeks, you'll get 25 ways to monetize your podcast. And then there's 25 ~diff ~different distribution tactics for you to get results. But not only am I sending everyone to this one [00:10:00] spot that. They can get all these, really good tips, but also it is creating this pillar post with links to, ~to ~my content, [00:10:10] which are previous episodes that I've done.\n\nSo if someone really wants to, for example, this one in particular, building audience engagement as a part one of the growth guide, [00:10:20] and it's like, okay, here are 25. Start by actually solving problems. And then if you want more, this is a whole episode that I've done with Ed Dale, that [00:10:30] someone can just go and click ~and, and ~so it's like not only is it creating a pillow post, it's creating an SEO worthy pillow post that now is getting linked to other [00:10:40] content that I've already created before.\n\nSo for me, this is very useful and very powerful for things that I've been wanting to do for ages that I've just never gotten [00:10:50] around to doing it. Or ~if I've got,~ if we've gotten to doing it, we've paid someone money and it hasn't gotten done the way we wanted to do, so it never got out. So these are things that I'm implementing that I think that you [00:11:00] should really look at and see how you can implement.\n\nBecause now this post already from the SEO, from the keyword analysis that we got, the analytics that we get from Google [00:11:10] is already ranking pretty well, and it's only been maybe a week and a bit that this post has been out. So, use AI for the things that you thought at one [00:11:20] time, Hey, I wish I could do that.\n\nAnd, now you can. If you just sort of focus, get it done, make sure you have a process to do it, and then keep repeating it before you get. [00:11:30] To do the next process. So don't worry about the new AI tools that are coming out, rather worry about these things that you can implement and execute and then start to get [00:11:40] results on.\n\n~I hope, I'm trying to,~ I hope I'm making sense about,~ you know, how, how I,~ how I~ I ask, I,~ I'm asking you to think about using AI\n\nronsley. Can I ask you a question about, ~about,~ you're on many platforms and then you're [00:11:50] writing. So for example what you just mentioned, do you have a, ~a ~ronsley filter persona, voice? For each platform? Or did you [00:12:00] set it up, let's say, for example, on chat, GPT and you like it the most there? So you'll take everything raw that you've created, on [00:12:10] other platforms like Cloud, and then run it through your voice on chat, GPT.\n\nI'm curious about that or do you have it set up on each platform and you're happy with the results? That's a great [00:12:20] question. So I don't really think that I'm very happy with the results that come out of chat GPT. I've never really been. Yeah, that was just hypothetical. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, I understand.\n\nBut [00:12:30] however much I have customized my chat, GPT or even the GPTs inside, actually I lie. ~Platform.~ So every, ~every ~[00:12:40] LLM has a backend, like a coding backend that is very dev focused. So for chat gt, it's, ~it's ~this platform dot,\n\n~platform dot what was it?~ openai.com. [00:12:50] And inside here ~you can~ if you go in the dashboard,\n\nyou come down to assistance. You can make assistance in here that are [00:13:00] really good. Like ~I, I,~ I trust these outputs better than I trust the output coming out of chat GPT. Again, I think it's because of the system instructions that you know, are [00:13:10] wrapped around chat g pt that doesn't give you the results that you want.\n\n~This is,~ this is way better. So in here I've created assistance that I can call on, which are very powerful. For [00:13:20] example, this one is the Amplify AI book. If I, ~if I~ throw any instructions at this assistant, it'll take the instructions and return back for you, [00:13:30] where in the book I cover. Whatever I'm,~ I'm~ asking of it.\n\nSo if, ~if, if~ you're trying to grow operations, then it'll go, oh, Ronsley has covered this in part one or part three of the [00:13:40] book. And on this page you can go and find how to grow operations in your business. So ~it's a, it's an, it's a,~ it's an assistant that's trained on my book. Then this, here's an assistant that's trained on [00:13:50] how I would like my mid journey prompts to be written so I can just throw anything at this and it'll return back a good midjourney prompt for me.\n\nAnd this is all in the backend. ~So,~ so [00:14:00] rather than me creating GPTs I create these assistants in the background. So I think this is really powerful, which again, I, I totally forgot to mention that. I think~ I, I, if you're any,~ if you're technically [00:14:10] inclined, then this is a really good place to do that.\n\nSo, to answer your question~ Scott, ~I really like my voice. My voice is very accurate. When it comes out of [00:14:20] Claude, I haven't found that in other LLMs. However, if I'm using a lot of data, then I, ~then I~ ask Gemini to, collate that because it can [00:14:30] take a larger context window. ~Mm-hmm. And then ~so for example, ~that, that,~ that post that you just saw, which was, you know, the 25 ways to improve your Podcast or Grow your Podcast chat, GPT Deep Research [00:14:40] did most of that research.\n\nBut then the writing part of that, the introduction and the bits in between were done by Claude because that represents my [00:14:50] voice better than what Chat GPT could. So, I think ~there's, there's,~ there's still an element of human checking involved which might not be too far away from, you know, an agent coming along and [00:15:00] you asking the agent to check how you check for your voice.\n\nBut until that point, I feel like us going through it ourselves and going, okay, this is how we would check it, is [00:15:10] probably a good idea so that you can give those rules to an AI in the future.\n\nWow. Thanks for lifting the covers on, you know, how you create that's really helpful for me. ~I. And I don't want to be greedy, but if I could just throw these out and you could maybe comment on them or defer later.~ But you didn't mention [00:15:20] video, so do you have a favorite video platform these days?\n\nAnd then just a side note, 'cause I'm a bit of a, ~a, a ~crypto guy. Your comic example for any [00:15:30] creators isn't blockchain the promise of getting rid of the middleman? And again, that can be, you know, we can do that in school in the discussions, but~ I'm,~ I just can't help but think in smart contracts, [00:15:40] you can get rid of all the middlemen, iTunes for music and, you know, Spotify and, you know, even, ~even~ buying a house or brokering a business, you can do it with [00:15:50] blockchain.\n\nI totally agree. I mean, I find the fact that they're paying bank fees an absolute joke. You know, absolute joke. ~And when I think about, so for some, for,~ for us. Our [00:16:00] largest bill are bank fees. ~By, by, by,~ by a long shot. And I'm talking about everything. 'cause Australia charges, me money when someone pays in USD and then charges me money to convert ~to ~[00:16:10] to from USD to a UD then it charges me money again.\n\nWhen I pay in USD out, ~it's a fuck.~ It's like I cannot stress enough how quickly I want smart contracts to come and [00:16:20] take over. Yes, yes. I feel your pain. I'm Canadian, so, and I'm in Mexico, so you know, US dollars always factor in and we get beat, you know, and we convert one to the other. [00:16:30] And I have begged businesses to work with, ~with ~crypto.\n\nIt's like, pay me in blood in Bitcoin, pay me in Ethereum. You know, pay me in ~in ~[00:16:40] anything other than fiat. And some do, some don't. But yeah, it's coming. ~I,~ I think see that's, that's the thing with change is that people don't like change and, you know, you know how many middlemen [00:16:50] would lose their jobs if smart contracts came around.\n\n~Yeah. Thanks Chris. Good to see you. ~So I agree 100%. It's just depends on how, the people in power want it to operate, I [00:17:00] suppose. Video you mentioned asked video. Yeah, I, I think trying so is is a good idea, but runway ML is probably the leader in that pack. ~Okay.~"

    "transcript": "135\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~it takes some getting used to, but I think everyone's not, no one's used to this time. So it's like just shafi and you in here? Yeah. So who I, I don't know. We'll see how we go. Like, we'll just try for a few, for a few days. Hey, Shafi, we can't hear you.~\n\n~It's all, how are you~\n\n~mano? Good to see you. Hear you. This, this, I tried this because a lot of, like, people in Europe were like, you know, your, your calls are at 12 o'clock or one o'clock, or whatever. So I thought, you know, let's, let's try a different time. So all my Australian friends are like asleep for sure, because it's like 12 and one and two o'clock in the morning there.~\n\n~But yeah, you guys are here. ~[00:00:00] I kind of wanna do a bunch of things today, ~so I, but mainly because it's a small group, maybe we can, we can, if you can just go and if you can tell me like what kind of use cases you wanna, try, then we can do that together rather than me go and just sort of lecture for the hour.~\n\nSo if you have any specific use cases that you want to try using ai, then let's chat about that. ~Boys, this is Stefano. He is 15 years old and he is just an AI enthusiast. And we love chatting ai, so actually Stefano's dad and I, and, and and I, we, we grew up together. So, yeah, it's he comes on these calls.~\n\n~It's really cool to have him actually.~\n\n~Yeah, so Manna and Shafiq, like if you have any specific AI use cases you wanna, you wanna cover or go through, I think that would be better use of our time than, you know. I, I just wanted to cover why I cancel my Chacha PD account. I can do that as well, but maybe be more specific to the two of you would be useful.~\n\n~I don't have anything specific. I don't know. I know if you have something specific. Not at the moment. I have to give it some thought. But~ [00:00:10] curious about your thing for the chat, GPT because also like last month I bought the, expensive one and I love it. So if you think there's anything better than that, ~I'm yeah, ~not, not necessarily better ~in the sense it was a gradual,~ for [00:00:20] me, it was a gradual waning away from chat GPT.\n\nSo we used to have, four plus accounts and one pro account. ~So we had a whole, and,~ and that was, the team was [00:00:30] using those accounts ~and, you know, that's what, there was so many,~ and then we just stopped using the plus accounts and moved over the Claude.\n\nso that became easier for what we were, ~what we were~ doing and chat. GPT wasn't giving us [00:00:40] the best results. And again chat, GPT's deep research is absolutely amazing, don't get me wrong, but there's a way around it. It's not, I mean, what I'm trying to say is if you can't afford the [00:00:50] $200 a month, there's another way to do it.\n\nMaybe I think. I think I've come across it. So I want maybe show you, ~show show~ some of that. ~Dana and Laura would love to, if you have any specific AI use cases that you want us to cover together for your particular business. I would love to be very specific and useful. So, if you wanna. Put it in the chat or unmute yourself and, and let me know.~\n\n~That would be, that would be phenomenal. Hey Resley, it's Laura. Hey, Laura. Hey. What's. ~So one thing that I still just [00:01:00] can't seem to get AI to really create good looking visual content. So maybe it's just not there yet, but like visuals for social media or [00:01:10] graphics or PDFs, like stuff that's a little bit more dynamic and detailed when it comes to visuals.\n\nYeah. Have you~ have you~ used mid Jenny? A little bit, but not in [00:01:20] a while. you'll appreciate this, Laura, because what happened was yesterday or the day before one of my things on my list that I have been putting off or has been moved by my [00:01:30] assistant over and over again was moving all our old lipsy podcasts over to Spotify, uhhuh only because.\n\n~They,~ we were not publishing them. They [00:01:40] were still getting views and listings and a lot of them, especially Bon apathy, gets a lot. But you know, we're not publishing anything new, so we didn't really have to pay what ~we were, we were paying,~ we were paying about, [00:01:50] I don't know, a hundred dollars a month maybe, and all Lipson fees.\n\nSo then what happened was I couldn't find a particular cover image for psychology of [00:02:00] entrepreneurship. So I was like,~ I can't find it. I, ~let me find,~ let me look, look, look.~ And then I landed up going, alright, just, ~just ~let me just create it. It was easier to make it so then using ai, [00:02:10] I just changed it to this.\n\n~Mm.~ That sounds like cool. ~Which,~ which is it? And then I was like, well, I'm on a roll. Let me just change, amplify AI as well. And I [00:02:20] changed amplify AI as well. So I think Midjourney is ~very, is is~ my favorite in making things. But let me show you some of the things I've been able to make in Midjourney. ~But yeah, like that.~\n\n~Anyone else have anything else? I'd love to be able to like. Be so specific like that and help you out. So, organize. ~So this is all the stuff that [00:02:30] I've created in the past, ~right?~ So just, you just see the different things. Now I think it's a lot in the company as well, ~Laura,~ because now if you see [00:02:40] this.\n\nWhich landed up becoming the cover image. I asked for an exploded view of an AI powered brain broken down into its main parts. [00:02:50] Augmented with ai, make it colorful and easy to understand. So I'm being very specific about what I wanted in the image. Are you being [00:03:00] that specific? Yes. And I think that.\n\nMaybe part of it is like I'm trying to get stuff that doesn't look AI ish or doesn't look sort [00:03:10] of futuristic. So if you see these images, right, ~these are, these are,~ because I've added my personalization to them, so that's why ~they look,~ a lot of these look similar. This is because it's my [00:03:20] style image and I've programmed mid journey to be you know, so, but there are some that don't have personalization.\n\nSo these are all personalized. But then let me show you [00:03:30] some that are just, and I haven't used Midjourney in a while. I kind of forgot about it, so I'll have to jump back into there. Yeah, ~that's, it's~ I've got another one as well to, ~to ~show you, ~but~ I'm, ~I'm ~a huge fan of Midjourney. I was [00:03:40] working with, ~I mean, you, you do you do ~animations.\n\nI was working with Gar Seamus. ~Do you know who he is? No.~ Gar Shamus is the guy that started ComicCon, sold ComicCon, and then when, oh, you guys are not running it properly, bought it back, grew it bigger, [00:03:50] made it like all over the planet, and then sold it again. he was like, Ronsley,~ I just,~ what I need to do is remove the middle person.\n\nLike I, I just want to make my art. And so we were making like characters [00:04:00] together, like these are just. I don't know, insane characters. Like look at the expressions on them that we were generating, like we were getting some really good, So what are you trying to create? You're trying to say [00:04:10] realistic images?\n\nYeah, I mean, so I've got clients that do different things. Like for social media for example, I've got a luxury real estate agent, and so I would want stuff [00:04:20] that's like ~I it ~that comes out decent, like with the Canva, ai and some other tools to make it just look like a house with a pool and like a palm tree sway.\n\nSo those ones aren't too bad, but every [00:04:30] once in a while, if you look closely, you can just tell that it. It isn't right. You know, like, yeah, maybe like half a palm tree or you're just like, things are overlapping weird or [00:04:40] whatever. Then like for my own children's book stuff, I would love to do characters like you were just showing.\n\nAnd I think I definitely have a hard time getting it to look just right, [00:04:50] even if I upload an image of what my artist did. But then also it's getting it to be consistent every time, so making that exact same character, have a different pose [00:05:00] or do a different thing. And those are just two use cases. I've got other clients, like in marketing, and so I'd want like a, you know, maybe something that would resonate with people who are trying to learn [00:05:10] marketing, like, ~like~ an infographic or, ~or ~something .\n\nYeah. Anytime there's text on the screen, it's always a mess. Right. Yeah, it is because they're two different, that's why it's called [00:05:20] multimodal in the sense that it's trying to do text and images at the same time, which~ is, is~ is hard. So, ~so I think he,~ I think what's happening is in general, it's, I mean, it's an [00:05:30] art in itself.\n\n~It's a, it's a,~ it's a trial and error in itself for you to, you know, if that's what I mean. ~I've not,~ I've not had the need to have. That accurate or specific? We've not created, [00:05:40] we've not created images that are, you know, realistic that we've used, ~but but I wonder whether I can show you a previous version of something that I created dashboard.~\n\nThis is another place to ~do to, to, to, to~ try images or, ~or ~other things, and it's very, very cheap to [00:05:50] run. If I show you maybe how much I've spent here, just to give you an idea, see January, like 78 cents and that's when I used it hardest, but, it, it's like [00:06:00] use, ~use~ as you go. So it's not really, you don't have to pay a subscription.\n\nIt's replicate.com, and then you go to Explore. And on the Explore you have all these different fine [00:06:10] tuned models. So this is the problem really. That's why ~you're not,~ we're not getting the results we want ~in, in,~ in just by using chat. GPT is because, it is a generalized model. If you [00:06:20] want something specific, then you gotta train that model to be specific in terms of the output that you want.\n\nSo for your case, you wanted realistic images, then, you know, you gotta have [00:06:30] a model that's trained in realistic images. For example, if you come down here there's a whole bunch of different things that, ~that ~you can do here, right? You can generate images. You use a face to make images, and [00:06:40] there are certain.\n\nModels already here that are very specific to use a face to get images you can use. Like there are models in here that are really good at text as well. [00:06:50] So~ I would,~ I would encourage you to explore this if images are your thing. Don't worry about the, ~the ~bottom view, but even if you go on to generate images.\n\nThe, ~the ~flux ones [00:07:00] are really good. ~I can't find the ones that I've done before, but they were really, ~see flux 1.1 is a really, you see 20.8 million runs.~ Mm-hmm.~ It shows you, it's a popular one and it's really gets text to image really well. ~I heard, I,~ our [00:07:10] team has done work on grok. This is Elon's stuff and images seem to be.\n\nCologne. ~with the name. ~Trees.~ I don't know.~\n\nSo the team have been like saying [00:07:20] that they're getting some good results, even by putting in an image and then asking grok to put text over those images or, yeah, [00:07:30] trees. See, it's not bad in terms of what. Yeah, we should never get the, ~the ~letters, the words. Yeah, this definitely looks better. And then I think we can [00:07:40] go make the shock so that it is at the golden. \n\nthat'd be interesting to see whether it does that.\n\n~Yeah, so even it, it's so like,~ it's even getting the golden hour,~ So I think where to go there, it's,~\n\n~that's, it's pretty interesting. But yeah, I mean images,~ I think [00:07:50] these are your option C. This one is very specific to creating models. ~This is also very popular.~ These two are very popular. I~ wonder whether I went into that.~\n\n~Anyway, I was trying to find, I, I did one of a, of a photorealistic podcast and it came out pretty intense that like piercing eyes and stuff like that. And it was, it was, it was pretty, it was pretty intense. Yeah, so I would, that, I would say that for images. Cool. Yeah. Anything else? You're welcome.~\n\nYeah. The only other thing I can say too is that I've got a [00:08:00] client for whom I do like really long resource guide articles, and so basically we'll pull transcripts of a bunch of [00:08:10] podcasts, like on a specific niche that we work on. So for example, the last one was nonprofit, so he did like eight interviews of different experts in the nonprofit niche.\n\nSo we've got. Notes that [00:08:20] he's taken on every episode and ~found~ what he found important. Notes I've taken, transcripts, all the things we put that in. And usually I was using like the pro version of chat, GPT, like the [00:08:30] paid one. And I would say, okay, like write me. An outline for an article. Now let's flush it out.\n\nAnd then I would use a tool called Market News, which would help me to find like all [00:08:40] the related keywords that I would need to use to really rank high for nonprofit marketing. And I would. Take those and I would then go back to ChatGPT and say, okay, [00:08:50] this is great, but now I need you to incorporate all of these like 25 words naturally and accurately.\n\nAnd I would give it to them and chat. GPT would usually only [00:09:00] do like 20% of the list, and then I'd be like, no, I need you to do at least 90% of the list. No, you missed this one. No. And it was just like, you don't know what's happening. [00:09:10] Yeah. ~Yeah. What's happening? ~What's happening is. That you've given it so much information that it's gone past its context window size.\n\nSo, oh, what it's doing is it's, ~it's ~forgetting [00:09:20] the previous work. Yes. Yes. That, ~that~ it's done. And that's why chat g pd D isn't the tool to use for what you are trying to do. Oh, if I were you, I would use Gemini just because [00:09:30] of the size of the context window that. You can, ~you can ~work with, so if you're using all that, those notes, then you put in a Gemini, you say distill it, and [00:09:40] you say, okay so I would not even use chat GPT in this instance.\n\nI would go, Gemini, here's all the transcripts. Distill, this is what I want. Make [00:09:50] dot points of that. Then take those dot points and go to Claude and write it in Claude. Okay. Because first of all, chat, [00:10:00] GPT, any writing in chat g PT is getting flagged as AI primarily. 'cause everyone's using chat, GPT, so mm-hmm.\n\n~The, the, the, the,~ the patterns inside chat, GPT are now being just labeled as [00:10:10] ai. So if you just use another model's gonna be way different to, you know, what is considered ai, so that, ~that ~would just change that in, ~in, in, you know, in~ a minute. But then, ~but then~ I [00:10:20] would do it in steps. So I would first go here and ~say here's all the~ open new chat.\n\nAnd then go here, all the files, and then tell it what the files are, and then ask it for very specific. [00:10:30] Encapsulation and say, gimme dot points. Take those dot points go into claude, and then with your, you know, set of custom instructions in the sense, I, I'm saying I [00:10:40] wanted to write in a certain way based on my style.\n\nMm-hmm. And then you give the dot points, and based on that, it'll, ~it'll, it'll, it'll~ write. For example, ~I've got a, some really cool use cases. Stefano and I were. We went to the beach last week, I think it was yeah, last th Thursday. Yeah. Yeah. And you know,~ Goa has like ridiculously awesome sunsets and we [00:10:50] were at this place that had like lot these rock formations.\n\nSo I build an AI ~that would literally,~ so one of the things that ~I'm,~ my team is asking me to do ~is, is do, do.~ Video, like face to camera, short [00:11:00] videos. So rather than just do any random short videos, it was, you know, ~I've traveled, I was,~ I've been in 36 cities in the last year. I went to speak a lot. I just went to like [00:11:10] the uk.\n\nI'm gonna Belgium next month. So the idea was I'm in all these different places. Why not use the place to record a [00:11:20] video, like a short video? So rather than me think, okay, I'm at this place. What's a script? How do I write the video? I just created a, an AI that, or trained a [00:11:30] small project AI here that all I do is say, write me a script.\n\nAnd say I'm at Hill, I'm at Poland Beach and go that [00:11:40] has a hill with different rock formations and none of them look the same, but it feels like they fit together perfectly. Write me a script and it writes me the script and I literally put the script in there ~and I, ~so from [00:11:50] idea to recording the video is three minutes.\n\nDo you understand what has just happened? That's crazy. Yeah. But it's very use case specific, right? And now because ~it's~ it's got my [00:12:00] voice, it knows what I'm trying to do. I, I've been very specific in how I want it to, ~to ~respond. So I just literally put this into a teleprompter on my phone and I recorded, ~and I,~ and we [00:12:10] recorded, and Stefan was like, I was one take.\n\nAnd I was like, yeah, that was one take. I had not even read the [00:12:20] script before I read it from the thing. What I'm trying to get at is creation has never been easier, and you can make it in your voice, in your style. [00:12:30] All you gotta do is what are the reps that matter for you and your business right now? ~Does that make sense?~\n\nThat would come in handy for some of my clients too. They like don't know what to say, but they wanna do more short video, So to make that would [00:12:40] be great. Make, ~make, make~ them an AI that will just remove that, ~that ~issue. ~ I wanna show you some of the things that ~so I just didn't renew this and now it says memory full.\n\nSo right now, ~whatever it see, ~whatever you see is like the free. [00:12:50] Chad, GPT. So the other day. \n\nand I still used it yesterday and, ~and~ today, and it like for what my small needs were, like Rochelle asked me something about, ~huh,~ how [00:13:00] to wash a particular like, jacket down jacket. So I took a picture of the down jacket and I was like, ~how do, well,~ how do I watch this? And it literally broke the thing [00:13:10] down.\n\nAnd this is the free chat, GPT. So, when you're looking and thinking about use cases it's, it's a lot more, you know, every day than, ~than, than~ what do you think about from a business perspective? But then I'm [00:13:20] doing ~a,~ a keynote ~for,~ for EO next month in, ~in ~Brussels. And I was like, what kind of humor?\n\nLike one line jokes specific to EO cohort in Antwerp. And I was like, [00:13:30] ideating that. And this was all on the free account by the way. So, I thought, wait a minute, I've actually never had the free account. I've always had the PRO or the plus account. So I [00:13:40] was very surprised by. What I could do with the free account, ~however,~\n\nSo as I told you, like, you know, there's a, ~there's ~a method to my, ~my~ madness of the,~ of the~ short [00:13:50] videos. I've got a certain way that I want it to be scripted ~and~ so I just said, Hey, you know, I'm gonna be in, Brussels and at well. On the 16th of April, I need you. This is deep research. This is [00:14:00] actually using the pro account or even the plus.\n\nI think you can do five or six or a few of these deep research using the plus account if you have that. But I kind of said, Hey, this is where I'm [00:14:10] gonna be. These are the kind of videos I wanna shoot. My goal is to experience the place, but also document the content. Can you. Ask me whatever was relevant [00:14:20] and create me an itinerary.\n\nSo it asked me what was relevant. I answered that, and then it went and made a whole itinerary. But not only did it make an itinerary, it then told me when I [00:14:30] go to certain places, what content to record.\n\nSo these amplifier videos that I'm doing now, it's like, okay, this is the corner. So ~you, you, you, you,~ in the afternoon go to this place, the Grand Palace, ~the grand places, and~ it's got a [00:14:40] story behind, and I just need to put that into the other AI and it'll just spit out this, ~the, the,~ the script. And I, ~and I~ just record that and then it becomes you know, a piece of content that is quite useful.\n\n[00:14:50] So when it does deep research, it is very powerful. And I highly recommend it actually for deep research. So it's done this like absolutely [00:15:00] amazing job of all the days, but then it's such a long thing that I went at the end when, okay, this is great, but using O one Pro, can [00:15:10] you please just create me a daily checklist of what I've gotta do so that I know exactly where I'm going, on what day.\n\nThen I just did that, which is now way easier~ you know,~ for [00:15:20] me to see what needs to be done. But I thought that was quite useful. Or it also asked me follow up questions because I've, got inside my settings or customization, I've got, [00:15:30] here address me as ronsley and always include to the three ~po follow~ potential follow up questions in every response. So here it was like, Hey, ~do you want~ do you want me to highlight any specific local entrepreneur [00:15:40] meetups or coworking spaces that you can connect with other Belgian founders? I was like, yeah, sure.\n\nAnd then it did that. So what I'm trying to get at is like, ~you know, this was,~ this was like a use case that I [00:15:50] didn't think I would need to use, but it's so powerful. ~Let me show you another one.~\n\n~Actually, no.~ So this is the free version. Okay.~ So I've, I've, I've used. I've used Deep, I've used Chat Jpd free. Okay? ~And I switched reasoning on. So if I open a new tab, I went into chat, like this is the free [00:16:00] version. If I just click Reason on, ~I click Reason. ~And I click search and kept those on. And I put in this prompt my audience at Business Founders, I'm presenting a keynote to an EO [00:16:10] chapter, knowing what you know about me and my mission.\n\nTake your time to understand, the goal to understand the goal only then outline for me what I need to cover that is imperative for them right now, as [00:16:20] well as what I will ~give, what I will~ give them the biggest return on the time spent with me. Very generic, simple thing. So then it gave me these things which I [00:16:30] copied and I went into perplexity.\n\nAnd inside perplexity, I said help me find sources to support this presentation. And I copied and pasted exactly [00:16:40] what chat GPT gave me. Again, ~this was the,~ this is the free perplexity with deep research switched on. Okay. And I think you can do five of these a day, which is. Quite decent [00:16:50] actually. So then it gave me this amazing breakdown with research, with links, with all these references to the content that I wanted.\n\n[00:17:00] Then I took that and I went into Gamma and I just copied and pasted that inside Gamma and I said, make me 10 slides.\n\nIt made the images [00:17:10] and it made the slides. And I'm talking about, ~I'm not even, I'm talking about~ this whole process took like five minutes, and I'm not saying that I'm gonna present this, but what I'm saying is my starting [00:17:20] point was like not a blank piece of paper. ~Does that make sense? ~I love that. Yeah.\n\nSo yeah, I mean, ~I don't necessarily think that, you know, you,~ I think you can use it in other places. Now, I just found out that copilot, if, ~if ~you don't [00:17:30] copilot is Microsoft's ai, which is powered by open ai. And if you. Come into copilot and you click Think deeper. This actually does deep [00:17:40] research inside copilot that's free.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that you don't need to have the $200 account because you know whether it's worth it or not. There are [00:17:50] other ways around that. This is definitely one of them. ~The one,~ the other one is just the one I just showed you with perplexity and asking perplexity. So if you open a new thread inside perplexity, you'll see here there are [00:18:00] these, you know, three options.\n\nThey're really powerful. So deep research does deep research. This is a pro, which is like gives you more sources than the normal one, [00:18:10] and this one uses advanced reasonings. If you're asking it for something complex that you wanted to reason, then use that. So for today as well, I've got three enhanced queries so I can use any of [00:18:20] these.\n\nThese are all for free. ~So, you know, it's, it's quite useful, ~one of the things that most business owners miss is, sending a regular update of the industry to the people that are already leads that they [00:18:30] already have. ~You know,~ like that's like the simplest way. To get clients is the people that already know you.\n\nJust nurture, them, and the simplest way to nurture them is to give them [00:18:40] updates that if they had to look for themselves, would take them ages.\n\n~ I'm just trying to get a gauge of where everyone's at.~\n\n~Yeah.~\n\n~Okay. So. Rather than me go off on a, on, on a, on another tangent and just, I had some notes on what to cover. Maybe maybe let you know. I, I either, if you have anything specific that I can cover, let's do that. Or, you know, we can all, we can all leave early. Classes ended. I have a question, Ron. If you look at the, the chat g PT on the settings, how did you set it up?~\n\n~So, it's easier for response and then you don't need to put it in. Maybe I don't have that done yet. good one. So, yeah. Okay. Great question. So, up the top when you have your image there, you'll come onto under customize. And now this customization is, is, is more than what it used to be, but it'll ask you what do you wanna be called which used to not be there.~\n\n~And then what do you do? Which is also very useful, especially for businesses. So I've written what I do and then what traits should chat GPT have? And I think this is how you tell it. How you want it to behave to you, with you. So for me, I'm being specific and I'm saying, Hey address me as ronsley. And then, and the reason it's addressed me as Ronsley is because these two things were not there before.~\n\n~It was only these two boxes that were there in the initial customization. So, and I said always include two to three potential follow up questions in every response because rather than me think. Of what to say. I'm having it think for me as follow up as well, so you can include that. Then I'm being very specific.~\n\n~About how I wanted to respond, like use language that is straightforward, forward and varied and more closely resembles conversational and human speech. This is my voice style, so I'm being, I'm telling it what my tone is, how I use storytelling and humor, where appropriate, what my voice is, how I use metaphors and analogies to explain concepts what my narrative style is, how to use storytelling elements.~\n\n~Then I'm also saying. Make sure you write in British English. And I have to say that it doesn't always follow that particular one because very simply it's, the model is trained on American English, so, it's. Its patterns of very American English. So the, the Z comes around all the time, which is kind of annoying a little bit.~\n\n~But anyway, I'm going avoid using the following phrases and I'm being very specific about what kind of phrases like delve and tapestry and realm and, you know, these, phrases that are very AI like, and then I, I sort of shut that down. And then the other thing that is useful is here. Put in your whole bio.~\n\n~So anything else chat, GPT should know about you. Yeah. You should know that this is, this is my bio, this is my focus, here is my vision and my mission. This is what I wanna do. I wanna reduce human cognitive load. So I wanna put all that in there. And yeah, that is how you customize. And actually you also want to go into.~\n\n~So I think my memory is settings. Oh yeah. So the only reason it's full is because it, it's gone from like pro, the $200 account to zero. So it's like telling me all my thing, the, the memory is full and no new memories will be created and that's totally fine. But go in here in your personalization and see what kind of stuff.~\n\n~Doesn't need to be here. You know what I mean? Like sometimes it remembers stuff that are not relevant. For example, in one of the memories here was something about Ronsley had this conversation about anger, but that's because I was on a walk and I was experimenting and I was talking to chat GPT and I was like, Hey, I want, I can, we have a conversation about how people can see anger differently.~\n\n~We had this whole back and forth about how, you can be angry, but you don't have to insult someone in the anger and all this, this long conversation, it was 22 minutes long, but then it remembered that part and it kind of put that in my memory, which didn't need to be there. You know what I mean?~\n\n~It was just like this one-off conversation. So those things look at and that's pretty much how you. How you would personalize that GPT, but mano, I think you're gonna join us for the 90 days, right? So if, if you're gonna join us for the 90 days, then like, I'm gonna show you how to do that in any AI and how to create like this very personalized AI that you can literally go and ask it things like, for example, I was at, I spoke at this event in in Manchester, and the person that followed me spoke about,~\n\n~ the five stages awareness. I mean, this is like marketing 1 0 1, the five stages that your customer is aware, they're unaware. They're either unaware, they're problem aware, they're solution aware, they're product aware, or they're most aware so they know everything about you. Right. So I just took a, clicked a picture of that and the, the presenter told the whole audience to, they had a worksheet and they were working their unaware, problem aware, solution aware.~\n\n~So I just clicked that and I went, knowing what you know about me and my business, apply that. And it did that in like. A few seconds. So while everyone was like filling out their worksheets, this was already done and it was only because I had that encapsulated and I could ask it questions. So we'll cover all this in the 90 days.~\n\n~Yeah.~\n\n~If someone else doesn't have any question, I have another question. So, yeah, in what way is it possible to make a. AI copy of you. So like when people have certain questions or the ways you help them, AI can answer that for them. And even like they can chat with the ai. Is that very hard to set up something like that where you download everything you normally talk about with people?~\n\n~Because a lot of my work is repetitive. Yeah. So how you arrange that data is important. What, what's happening right now is ~~people are not getting the results because how Laura at the start was talking about, you know, putting all this data in and, and it not getting the right responses because it can't, there's a big difference between search and intelligence.~\n\n~When you search, it's looking for that exact phrase. It's finding that exact phrase, that phrase isn't there. It's saying it's not there~~. If it's there, it's kind of going, it's there. Intelligence is different. Intelligence is not doing that. ~~Intelligence is going is more like, I'm already trained in this.~\n\n~Ask me a question, and then it's giving you a conscious stream of output.~~ That was the first model. The new models, the reasoning models are going, okay, let me think about what you just said. And I think what you said is this, and it's breaking it down, and then it's using that thinking in its output.~\n\n~Does that make sense? So for you to create something of your own, you'd want to know, firstly, I would ask you to do this, write what the result looks like. Okay. Right. What kind of information needs to be there, those results to happen? So, so say for example your repetitive work that you're talking about, what are the use cases and then what kind of material do you need for those use cases to be to be fulfilled?~\n\n~ So what I mean by that is if your customer is asking for. Say it's a customer service. You know, say you're a business coach and you, you've got all these trainings, and the customer's like, oh, I need to find how to do X. What are the trainings? So you would have to like go, okay, my framework is maybe attract, convert, deliver.~\n\n~So it'll either fit in one of those three. Boxes. And if my customer's asking me this question first first find out whether it's in those ca in in those categories and then in those categories what kind of training is relevant for what they are. Then the training will have to be encapsulated and put into an AI so that it can respond with accuracy.~\n\n~ So it's just a process of. collecting the right data and putting that in the right order. So if you can start off with the use case, what kind of sample questions that people will kind of ask, and then what kind of data needs to be put in there. Then in our next session like this, we can then break it down and start talking about how to put it together.~\n\n~Yeah, I. Cool. Anyone else? Anything else?~\n\n~No. Stefano, how you going with Cursor? Are you playing with that? I've been playing around with Cursor more like it's actually translated the whole thing to react really well. The only thing that was a problem was like setting up the whole React environment, Android studio and everything. But other than that, the coding part, it handled it really well.~\n\n~So compiled and everything done, like I have it running on an avior, so now I have to see how to get it on the app store in place, so, so I can do actual tests. So ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know what just happened Stefano was having this issue with a coding issue and there's a, ~~there's an AI app called Cursor, which pretty much does.~\n\n~All the coding for you. And it feels kind of useless that I went to university to learn all this stuff, but it, he kind of just put that in and it wrote all the code for him and it compiles and now it's an app that he just has to put on the app store which is insane. So, talk about how AI is changing the game.~\n\n~Only a software developer prop, like that was the biggest problem with software was, was. You know, if something was not working, we didn't know how to fix it, and sometimes it would compile and we're like, oh, where's the problem? But now you can just put that into AI and, and then, and debug it.~~ So, that's cool man.~\n\n~Keep, keep us updated on, on how that's going and what's the next step for the. But I still have to do some debugging that if I didn't understand what was going on, I feel like there would've been a lot more problems. So there were some areas that have to be specific and plus it's not like I asked it to do from scratch.~\n\n~I had the tablet with the website already, so I just said, convert this to type three. I looked at all the research for how I'm going to run it on an Android thing, but now I've started brainstorming with more ideas with, and if you, if I gave it like the context of like, what are simple ways you could help in everyday lives?~\n\n~And it actually follows that context really well when it's brainstorming. Yeah, that's, that's cool. Awesome. Well, thanks team. Gotta hang out. We'll try one last question. Sure. Is there another tool that does similar to what Chatt PT does with the agents out there, like the. I was testing the, the $200 a month one with chat, GPT, and I was, I had like five different windows open and a different chat agent was doing research and compiling it into a spreadsheet operator.~\n\n~Oh, yeah, operator. Yeah.~~ I don't think operators like functioning that well~~ in the sense that, no, it drove me crazy. So I can't, it's nots. Yeah. No, it's not you. It's not you. It's, it's them releasing something in a, in a marketing ploy against deep seek. Because deep seek came out and they had to like, put something out.~\n\n~They, they put out operator. It's not functioning well. It's not doing what it's supposed to do. So the promise is there, but it's not really like I, I, I haven't seen a single use case that is. Useful yet on Operator, and there's another tool that does similar yet, oh, there is MON minus ai, but again, that's a Chinese company, Uhhuh, and there's nothing wrong with them.~\n\n~It's just that the, the US is using that as a marketing thing. But they're all open, open source, which is crazy. which is insane because O Open AI is called Open ai, but they're not open at all. they're closed. So minus AI and deep seek and minus are both open source, which means, you know, which means we know everything. We know how it's working, we know the training. We know how it's taking the data, how it's using the data, how it's thinking. It, we, we know everything. It's, and, and not only we know all that, it's open source, which means other people are building on all the work that they've done, which is ideally the way we want it to be.~\n\n~But Manas is like that, that unfortunately it's got so much of hype right now that, that they're, it's, it's like invite only and, and I haven't been able to get in even though someone sent me a code, that code didn't seem to work. So, I've just joined the waiting list and I'll have to see.~\n\n~But if you watch some of these videos,~\n\n~mind mind blowing absolutely insane. What is possible? And on, on the same note by the way, I using the deep research tool, I asked it to create me like this. So I said, find me a hundred ways to improve and grow a video podcast. Do this specifically for my audience. This is who my audience is. And then it asked me some clarifying questions and took five minutes.~\n\n~Came out with all the, like, literally a hundred ways purchase versus pre-launch and launch strategies, content strategies production, like everything, A hundred Ways to Improve Video Podcast. And we don't see your screen if you want us to see it. Oh, shit. Sorry.~\n\n~That's funny. I was, I was just showing you a chat. GPT, yeah, so this is using deep research, using the $200 and saying, find me a hundred ways to improve and grow video podcasts. And then give me like, a hundred ways and strategies to grow a business video podcast, which is ridiculous. When you think about how to compile something like that.~\n\n~Then another thing is this is useful. This'll find useful. Laura. Laura, like I then said, well wait a minute. Can I improve on that? I've done already 350 episodes on We Are podcasts. Just use that as your reference. So it then made a hundred Ways to Grow Your Video podcast using We are podcast episodes.~\n\n~Wow. And here is the video. So, so rather than put, release them as a hundred, the team has started to release them in, in, in batches of, of 25. So here's the one on, on audience build audience. And again, these are all previous, previous podcasts. So it's the, tip, and if you want more on the tip here is when you go to listen to it.~\n\n~What the fuck? That is insane. That is insane. Right? And then the second one, which went out last week, I think, was this one. So then I think next the following will be the third one and that, so on. So yeah, if you already have the $200 one, that's kind of a useful thing to do. I canceled it 'cause it was driving me crazy.~\n\n~But it'll get better. It'll only get better. And and, and, and, and the, ~~the inside news is that OpenAI is not profitable.~~ Okay. So they're not, they might be have all these users, but for the amount they're spending for compute. They're not actually profitable, so they need to be in a monopoly to win.~\n\n~So they're trying everything to shut down, deep seek, and these other players in the game. Because otherwise, you know, they, they're not actually a profitable business, but that's on the, on the down low. We don't know how true that is, by the way. So yeah, neither here nor there. Cool. Yeah. Well, thank you so much.~\n\n~You're welcome. I love, I love these sessions. So thanks for showing up team. Good to see everyone. I'll see you next week.~\n\n~Right. Bye. Have a good day. Yeah, bye.~"

If you look at the, chat g PT on the settings, how did you set it up?\r\n\r\nSo, it's easier for response and then you don't need to put it in. Maybe I don't have that done yet. Great question. So, up the top when you have your image there, you'll come onto under customize. And now this customization is, more than what it used to be, but it'll ask you what do you wanna be called which used to not be there.\r\n\r\nAnd then what do you do?

    "transcript": "Matt Alder\n===\n\nMatt Alder: ~Oh right. Okay. I'll just pause for a couple of seconds. I'll say hello. We're up and running. So all set.~ [00:00:00] Hi Ronsley, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nRonsley Vaz: Hey man. How's it going? How's it going, Matt?\n\nMatt Alder: Really, really good. ~And it is an absolute pleasure to have you on the show. Please, for the benefit of everyone, could you introduce yourself and tell us what you do?~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Well, I've actually thought it was the host job to do that, but anyway.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~We, we won't mention your, we won't mention your background in your background in podcasting and things like that we expect me to critique as I go along.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Well,~\n\nMatt Alder: ~of course I'm gonna record a lovely intro for you, but I wanted to hear it in your own words as well.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~So it's so much easier when someone else does it 'cause you don't actually know what to put in there. And a lot of the times they feel, oh, should I mention that? Should I not? But the best way to explain what I do or what I've been doing is the first part of my career, I was talking to computers. I'm a computer scientist.~\n\n~Software engineer can program in 21 languages. My first job out of university was to program a tractor to wake up in the morning and plow the field using GPS and park itself. Give you a rough, I, this was way back in the day. It feels like such a long time ago. And then the next part of my career was talking to humans, as you mentioned, podcasting.~\n\n~And 13 years in the field, I suppose, started the first podcasting conference in Australia. Signed the first deal with Amazon Audible in Australia, you know, and easily companies would've done. Help at least a thousand thousand 100 podcast businesses and brands start and grow a podcast, you know, over the last 13, 14th year now.~\n\nSo I've been~ a, a,~ a proponent of amplification [00:00:10] for a while. And it's really interesting because I find the overlap and the overlap is I love amplifying [00:00:20] people's genius. ~So, you know,~ whether it was podcasting or ai, now. Which, you know, the two parts of my career have come and joined ~and, and,~ and had a baby almost with their artificial intelligence.\n\nSo, I feel [00:00:30] like they're both amplifiers in a huge way, especially of people's genius. If they've done something and they're the ones that [00:00:40] feel like the best kept secrets in the industry you know, then it feels like these are two elements that would really, really help them.\n\nMatt Alder: ~And, and, and that's why I wanted you to introduce yourself basically. 'cause I think that you know, that unique background you have of like content creation, marketing, and being a software en being an actual software engineer. It just, I, I just think it's just, it's why it's amazing to talk to you about ai.~\n\n~So. You mentioned, you know, you, you started off programming tractors to plow fields and things like that.~ So you've obviously been, you [00:00:50] know, looking at this space ~for a,~ for a long time. Are you surprised by the developments of the last two or three years?\n\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah, I think ~anyone, ~anyone in any capacity [00:01:00] would be surprised at the speed at which it's happened. ~So to give you context, I did so,~ so it took me four years to get a bachelor's of, of, of engineering, okay. Computer Science and engineering. Then it [00:01:10] took me another three years to get a Master's software engineering, another two years to get ~a.~\n\nAn MBA, and this is while I was working, the masters were while I was working, but to give you context of when I went to [00:01:20] university, this was just a theory. The blockchain was just a theory. You know, we had an idea of what could happen in a [00:01:30] decentralized system. We didn't have fast enough computers. We didn't have, you know, that much data that we could store internet was not even fast enough.\n\nSo there's all [00:01:40] these limitations that didn't allow or even allow us to conceptualize this far ahead. However, I. If you know the curve ~of,~ of [00:01:50] adoption, not only adoption, but the curve ~of,~ of how much computing power you can fit into ~a,~ a small inch is a exponential curve. [00:02:00] So this massive improvements that have happened over the last few years, I mean, when the first supercomputer got built, it almost was like someone ran the first four minute [00:02:10] mile.\n\nIt just started to. You know, people started to break those barriers, which were thought of as it was impossible, almost just [00:02:20] 'cause the hardware could not support the theory. So yes, of course, 100%. It would be stupid not ~to, not to, to,~ to say that anyone that would knew exactly that this was where we're [00:02:30] headed.\n\nWe knew that in theory. But this quickly, I don't think so.\n\nMatt Alder: And do you think ~that ~that this sort of kind of incredible sort of pace of [00:02:40] change, ~this,~ this curve, vertical curve we're going up with, is that sustainable? Are we likely to see the same kind of speed of development over the next five years? ~I.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: I think it is sustainable. I think the only thing ~that's, that's,~ that's, [00:02:50] that doesn't allow it to be sustainable is humans need for not wanting to change is probably the only thing that\n\nMatt Alder: Yeah. No, that's interesting.\n\nRonsley Vaz: yeah, that will come in the way. But in [00:03:00] terms of. What is possible if you look at Industrial revolution and ~how much,~ how much we do with machines already, but we don't even remember.\n\nWe just think it's normal. It's not normal [00:03:10] to control the temperature of a room. ~It's not, you know, it, it is. We,~ we just take a lot of these things for granted. Yes, it is sustainable because it's been gradually happening. It's just that we don't notice that it's happening.\n\nMatt Alder: Yeah, ~that's a,~ that's a kind of a stunning point [00:03:20] actually, just in terms of ~how quickly we take,~ how quickly we take things. ~For, for, for,~ for granted. I wanna dive into ~the, the, the,~ the human part of this in a second because it's sort of really important ~for for our,~ for our industry and the sort of ~the, the,~ the conversations that we're [00:03:30] having and the technology that, ~that, that we, ~that we are seeing develop.\n\nBefore I do though, I just wanted to get your view on there is so much hype about. Gen AI now, and [00:03:40] agenda AI and agents ~and all this,~ and all this kind of stuff. Where's the line between hype and reality? Are things being overhyped? Are people sort of talking about things that are gonna be possible in a [00:03:50] year's time as if they're possible.\n\nNow, what's the, ~where's the,~ where's the line of reality currently?\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Well, that's a great question because it's,~ it's an annoying. Goddamn line, especially for me hearing some people [00:04:00] say really dumb stuff publicly, but it's the bro code of marketing, you know, to fake it till you make it. It's so, I don't [00:04:10] know whether that part has changed. I think there's always gonna be a bunch of people that will take that and use all these fancy words.\n\nLike there are people, ~I,~ I actually watched a really good friend of mine [00:04:20] and very well known entrepreneur, put out a post about, we just built three agents ~in ~in the last half an hour. No, you did it. You built an assistant if that. [00:04:30] It's a big difference between assistant and an agent. And so maybe to clarify for people listening, an assistant is someone that you hand over a task to [00:04:40] and you say and guide and hold hands with, and you get ~your, your,~ your solution.\n\nAn agent is, here's my task, get it done, and it'll [00:04:50] find the best way to do it and do it with a checklist and create assistance to help. The agent achieve. So it's agentic [00:05:00] behavior. It's hands off. ~ more, I suppose, what people think it will get to. And it's already here, by the way. It's not like it's not, but it's not that easy to make.~\n\n~It's not that easy to. Especially teach someone else, you know? So,~ so of course there's a hype. There's a hype, yes. And it's usually the marketers that are making the hype. ~And then it, so~ I think the marketers are on one side making the hype, and then there's the media [00:05:10] that's pulling everyone down.\n\nAnd there's somewhere in between,~ you know,~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Somewhere in between is the, is the~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~is~ is the entrepreneur's way to, to find their own space in this world, because here's what's. [00:05:20] This will easily be the biggest conversation of our lifetime.~ There's not,~ there's no debate on that. It's gonna change how we even educate our kids. Right. It's changed everything.\n\n~So, so I think conversations aside, I think we all gotta take responsibility to learn this because just like the web and the internet even that is a small spec as to what. Possibilities are with ai and right now the way people are using ai, it's like, you know, you have a laptop, but you're using it as a paperweight to, to put over your bills.~\n\n~So you know, people are still not using it to its full capacity. And you know, it's obviously being hyped a lot.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Yeah. And I think the reason I,~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~the reason I ask you that is because, you know, certainly in talent acquisition we've got this huge amount of hype about what's possible and what's not possible and and that sort of thing. And then on the flip side, a lot of people's experience of, I. Gen AI is just seeing LinkedIn full of kind of I ident posts.~\n\n~You know, and that to many people is, is, is generative AI people just using chat GPT. And, and there's a really kind of, sort of false narrative that it's not that sophisticated. It does this, it's not very interesting. You can easily spot when someone's using it, but you couldn't be more wrong.~\n\n~Could they?~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. You know, if, if, if someone's like, oh, I, I write all my content myself is like saying I didn't use a calculator to do the, the math on this, or I washed my clothes by hand, or I back, I, you know, manually. Swept the floor or didn't use the vacuum cleaner. You know, it's just such a, it's such a handicap to not use ai, but the problem is that most people are not using it correctly.~\n\n~So they're getting very generic results and as a result, they kind of associate AI with that. I mean, same thing happened with Facebook, right? When first Facebook came out, everyone that had a Facebook account was a social media expert. And, I don't think even they knew what they were doing in a lot of respects, which is what's happening right now.~\n\n~But, you know, I just wish that people listen to the right people. But in general, if you think about how the world's working, you know, the ones that are shouting the loudest are really the ones that are being heard. I. If you think about it, they might not have the expertise. Even you look from afar. I'm talking about not only world governments, I'm talking about in general, it's a, it's a very common theme in organizations.~\n\n~We tend to carry, like we tend to view and influences view on a topic more highly than an expert's view on that same topic. So. I suppose we shouldn't be surprised and you know, it's stupid to fight the current, I suppose, but, you know, knowing the current and then swimming along in a way that gets you to where you wanna go is probably the way to do it.~\n\n~And I think to answer your question, most of us get caught in the current because we actually don't know where we want to go.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Hmm. No, I think that's the thing. And I think also, people just don't perhaps appreciate the sort of the sheer breadth of tools that are available and exactly how to use them. And you know, all, all those kind of things and some, some incredible things are, are already possible with with what we've, what we've kind of got access to.~\n\nI [00:05:30] wanna shift to talk about this humans, machines, relationship, competition, whatever it is ~in ~in recruiting. There is ~a, a,~ a kind of a real sort of debate, [00:05:40] a moment about how much, aI should or can do ~in,~ in the recruitment process. And I think that people are perhaps drawing the line ~in the,~ in the wrong place.\n\nI [00:05:50] think that there's a feeling that humans can do some things better, that actually we really know computers can. Where does the. Ultimately, [00:06:00] where does the line between humans and machines sit with this? What is it that humans can do that machines can't replicate or certainly can't replicate now or in the near [00:06:10] future?\n\nRonsley Vaz: I don't think there's anything that humans can do that he, that, that won't be ultimately I'll tell you why. Because I think if you understand~ the, the,~ how AI has [00:06:20] come together, there's a, is a combination of neurology and psychology and physics and chemistry and math and computer science. There's so many, there's about eight or nine different fields [00:06:30] that come together to create ai, the field and.\n\nComputers are built on us. It has long-term memory. It's got short-term memory just like us. It's got [00:06:40] compute just like us. It's got neurons firing in certain ways just like us. So, you know, it's the only reason some of the things are not possible [00:06:50] yet is because we've not found a way to articulate what that is.\n\nFor example, emotional intelligence is probably a new-ish. [00:07:00] Field and you know, our parents might not even know what being present might even mean as an example. ~So it's only newly this, these,~ these topics are only being [00:07:10] able to be expressed now. And, but over time, you know, we know for a fact certain things we're not good at, we're not good at memory, you know, we're not good at [00:07:20] memorization.\n\n~So it,~ it would not be smart. To go against a computer that is extremely good at memory. [00:07:30] So there's certain things right now you can only see that and when ~you,~ you keep asking about the line, I think we're gonna constantly def redefine that line. I think that line's gonna [00:07:40] change. It's gonna be very drastic.\n\n~They, there was a time when. All of us didn't like, you know, re rebelled against emojis and selfies, but we, we use them now, you know, so.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~I,~ I remember cam cameras on phones seemed like the most ridiculous thing that anyone had ever invented.\n\nRonsley Vaz: right. And, ~and now you see, it's a,~ it's a [00:07:50] whole new version of a human that are being I suppose, educated to operate. World in different ways. And I'm talking [00:08:00] about schools. I'm talking about through social media and different types of media and parents ~and, and,~ and how parenting is even done and how learning is even done.\n\nThere's so many, so much has changed, right? [00:08:10] And it'll continue to change. So that line is super hard to draw right now for the future. ~But as, as we stand, do the things that AI can't do right now, which is be courageous. Be collaborative be connection worthy, you know, those are the things that are super hard to do right now.~\n\n~And with AI is what I mean, and what's happening is people are just doing the same thing, right? You, you talk about LinkedIn earlier, they're just same regurgitated stuff, you know, it's AI generated, you can see it. But if they just was courageous enough to make that phone call that they've been avoiding, and that's why they put out this article, would've been way better for them than actually, you know, put using ai.~\n\n~So in a lot of instances it's just, you know, I. Not wanting to do the courageous thing or not wanting to do the collaborative thing, or not wanting to do the connection piece, and you're so disconnected, funny enough, being so connected as a, as a human species, but totally disconnected as a human being is more and more prevalent.~\n\n~And you, you'd agree with me on that. I think.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Yeah, no, I would yeah, no, I agree.~ I agree a hundred percent. And I think that~ yeah, you know, going back to what you said about this is the, the biggest conversation we'll we'll ever have. I mean, you know, 1,000,001. Million percent agree with you there. And I suppose to, to kind of help people with this,~ so how do we sort of move ~from,~ from [00:08:20] panic ~and ~and denial towards sort of opportunity and strategy?\n\nRonsley Vaz: Oh, I love this question for a variety of different reasons. ~It's in the, ~it's in the opening of my book and in the opening of my [00:08:30] book. I talk about have you ever, have you heard of David Hawkins, Dr. David Hawkins, map of Consciousness. ~I.~\n\nMatt Alder: ~I, ~oh, maybe not sure.\n\nRonsley Vaz: So Dr. David Hawkins is, you know, [00:08:40] from the seventies he's done this lot of work ~in, in,~ in calibrating frequency and consciousness, and he's got the map of consciousness and it goes from a scale of zero to a [00:08:50] thousand. 20 is guilt and 40 shame,~ or, or,~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Okay. Yeah.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~yeah. So, or,~ or one or the other. And then, so it's called power versus force forces.\n\nAll the frequencies from zero [00:09:00] to 200, it's all force from 200 to a thousand is all power. And at 200 is [00:09:10] courage, which is really interesting. I mean, I didn't even think of that until I'm talking to you right now. ~I, I should actually confirm that, but but you know, so, so, so. You could be vibrating.~\n\nEveryone's vibrating at a certain frequency, okay? So if you are vibrating at [00:09:20] guilt or shame in the lower forties and twenties, you'll see a certain event in a certain way. If you are vibrating at reason or courage or anger [00:09:30] or love, it doesn't matter. Depending on the frequency you're, you'll see the same act differently.\n\nSo it could be a simple act as me. Walking out, out, out of this conversation and [00:09:40] getting a cup of coffee. Depending on where you're at on that spectrum, you'll see it differently. So I ask you, whoever's listening that, where are you vibrating [00:09:50] at? Okay. ~The first thing, and I would, I would ask you that. I would,~ I would say to you as a human, you are only job right now is to make sure that you are moving your vibrations up.\n\nBecause that's something that, you [00:10:00] know unless you replace the hardware of a computer. It's super hard for an artificial intelligence piece to do. So it depends on where you're at. And [00:10:10] I'm gonna say to you ~that,~ that I'm very hopeful for the future. 'cause I don't feel like, 'cause I don't feel like [00:10:20] being the opposite is useful to where we're going.\n\nOkay, so there's two ways to look at this. Now you can either be, so artificial [00:10:30] intelligence is learning from us. You know, we know that we can either be the parent that says, do as I say, or we can be the parent that says, do as I do. ~So we,~ if we keep [00:10:40] going down this path of someone has to lose for me to win, then we are not headed down the right path in this AI race.\n\nAll. But if [00:10:50] we go down the path of this collaborative nature here, there's ~enough ~enough for everyone. There's abundance, there's let's all connect. Let's not divide over all these [00:11:00] differences. Let's you know, do the courageous thing. There's a lot of hope for what we can do. Then becomes the augmentation of intelligence, the thing [00:11:10] that we crave.\n\nWhich is autonomy and freedom to do what we want to do, and we want to do it is totally possible because I [00:11:20] do feel like AI can solve some of the world's biggest problems. What it comes down to is whether the humans in power will [00:11:30] allow that to happen. You know, so there's so many elements here that are at play, and that's why having an open [00:11:40] source anything.\n\nAI is the way forward. It can't be closed, it can't be, it can't be policed. It can't [00:11:50] be you know, rules can't be put on it because it needs to thrive. It needs to flourish, ~it needs to be, it needs to, ~it needs to grow, and we need to find better ways to do what we're doing.\n\nMatt Alder: No, [00:12:00] absolutely. I think that finding better ways to do what we're doing~ is the, it's kind of the real,~ is the real sort of core of this. 'cause I think people are kind of protecting. Ways of working and institutions ~and,~ and things like that, [00:12:10] that don't actually do the best job ~at what they~ at what they could do.\n\n~And I think recruiting is a, is a classic example because you know, you talk to any, anyone who's looking for a job out there and they'll tell you that it's a terrible. Dehumanizing process. And we've just gotta do better than that. And I'm really optimistic that AI is, is what's gonna help us, is what's gonna help us do that.~\n\n~So let's just talk a little bit more sort of tactically for, excuse me, voices just going, I need to replace myself with ai. ~So let's talk a little bit more tactically. What is it that people can be doing right now to kind of really get up to speed [00:12:20] with what's possible to educate them themselves?\n\n~You kind of mentioned listening to the right people. ~How should people be experimenting? What kind of mindset is there? ~What, what, what,~ what do we all need to be doing?\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~It is this, that's, ~that's a very big question. I think just learning, [00:12:30] just taking responsibility of the fact that, you know, this is a new skill that you might not have, and I. Just 'cause you get a response out of [00:12:40] chat, GPT or any AI doesn't mean it's the right response. So there's an element of knowing what you're doing and how you are asking.\n\n~And so, you know,~ [00:12:50] in business or in general, there's this value alignment gap that we all have in the sense that it's hard for us to express exactly what's in our brain. [00:13:00] So that's why the delegation piece becomes hard, especially, you know, recruitment. Someone comes on for the first time, that's why there's an onboarding process.\n\nThat's why there's [00:13:10] some training involved to get them up to speed with the lingo and how things operate in the new business. So I feel like ~there's,~ there's an element ~of ~of having to [00:13:20] learn these new skills. And then one of the, one of the. Easiest skills to learn is logic is how does a computer [00:13:30] operate?\n\nWhat is required for the computer to do its best work? What is not common sense? What is common [00:13:40] sense? What is explicitly required to be mentioned? What is not? How does the computer. [00:13:50] Operate in terms of the process that you're asking of it. So there's all these different elements that I feel is being missed because people are selling prompt packs [00:14:00] just to make a quick buck, and the copy and paste prompts will work, but you just don't know what's happening.\n\nYou just don't know why it's working. [00:14:10] And sometimes they don't even work. It's probably a prompt pack that they've put through another AI and just sold it to you. ~So, you know. Being,~ being more responsible of how this works and [00:14:20] where it works is probably the first thing. The second thing is not necessarily to look at the new AI tools or the new AI news that's coming out all the time, [00:14:30] but to build on whatever value piece you bring to the table.\n\nSo if you've already spent. I think most [00:14:40] people, you talk about the panic earlier, Matt and you, the panic comes from, oh, I've spent 20 years of my life doing this. What if it goes away? [00:14:50] Rather than, oh, I've spent 20 years of my life doing this. I know more about this, and if I augment that 20 years that I have of [00:15:00] experience with this artificial silicon-based intelligence, I could potentially be untouchable, ~you know?~\n\n~I think it's, there's, there's a way of looking at that. So rather than look at, look at it from a, a place of lack, you know, so if you think about driving or drivers, you know, we knew, we know that drivers are not gonna be a thing going forward, or it's gonna be much, much less, you know, drivers are gonna, as a, we've known for 10 years at least, if not much longer.~\n\n~So, but talk about that, that first job that I had, that was. Unmanned vehicles. That was in 2006. So you know, that was even operational back then and you know, deployed back then. It just not in public spaces. So drivers are gonna be a thing that will be different going forward, but the ones that will probably do really well are the drivers that kind of go, well, what part of my job is not replaceable?~\n\n~How do I could I, could I become a, a recruiter for drivers for their next job? That's gonna be a, that's gonna be a field. Like, I'm just making stuff up right~\n\nMatt Alder: ~Yeah, of course, of course. It's like looking at that kind of opportunity and it's kinda interesting 'cause I was at a conference last week in the US called Transform and the Transform, I think it was originally called Transform hr. I. The reason I like it is it's full of people having these conversations.~\n\n~So I was talking to someone who had been a recruiter for over 40 years, and they were there to think about how they could take their knowledge and build AI tools that would, would scale it. And it was exactly that kind of conversation is the kind of conversation we need to be having, not the. It would ever catch on.~\n\n~I don't wanna use it. It's I'm,~ I'll always be much better than machines. And it was just refreshing to [00:15:10] have those kind of con, it's just brilliant to have those kind of conversations. ~And, and,~ and change happens. ~I,~ I have a friend who owns a farm and you know, it, I think he inherited, you know, it's a family farm.\n\n[00:15:20] When he was young, there were 10 people working on the farm. Then there were five people working on the farm. Now it's pretty much just him because. ~The,~ the tractors kind of plot their own route and he can, you know, with a [00:15:30] bit of freelance help for want of another word, he can run the farm by himself.\n\nAnd that's technology. ~That's, that, that's, that's done that. So, so yeah, the, ~the evidence is out there for people. The evidence is out there for people to see. A hundred percent. Just [00:15:40] to, I suppose maybe just to give people a little bit of a kickstart, 'cause I think there are lots of people who are just kind of stuck with chat GPT and that's ~the, the,~ the whole world of AI for them.\n\n[00:15:50] What are the, what are some of the sort of favorite tools that you use, or what are things that people could~ you know, play,~ play around with and get some value from really quickly?\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~We,~ I just did a training ~for,~ for my group [00:16:00] last week about how we used to have multiple chat GPT accounts, ~including,~ including the pro $200 ones, and we've gotten slowly just waned [00:16:10] off chat GPT and we're all on the free version of chat GPT right now. So, you know, it's interesting how we've gone. From chat GBT plus, and we have [00:16:20] multiple plus accounts, and then ~we've got the pros account.~\n\nWe've got a couple of pro accounts, and then when actually there are other ais that are doing that can do us the job and we don't [00:16:30] need all ~these,~ these chat GBT accounts. Yeah, because ~I think what, you know, the, in the,~ there are different types of businesses when you think about the three main elements of a businesses attract, convert, and deliver.\n\nThe [00:16:40] businesses that are really good at attract, there's business really good at Convert, and there's businesses that are really good at deliver and they have to learn the other bits, but some of them are really good. So I think OpenAI is really [00:16:50] good at attract and they've done a great job. ~I,~ I don't think they're profitable and there's a huge rumor out about how I.\n\nWhether they are actually profitable with, you know, how they've been [00:17:00] operating so far. ~And it could very well be that they're not profitable. So neither here nor there,~ but I'm just trying to say that there's so many other tools that you should look at and not only look at the tools, but look at how you talk [00:17:10] to the tools.\n\nBecause if you know how to talk to the tools, then you. Yourself can engage whether that tool is good for you. Like I know that if I use a [00:17:20] certain tool, I know, okay, well I'm not getting the result I want because I know that my conversation too is correct. So I don't have to like debate whether [00:17:30] this tool is good or not.\n\nSo I think that's the first piece. Understand how you can communicate. The next is there's so many. Anthropic by Claude, by Anthropic is probably my, one of my favorites right now, [00:17:40] Gemini by Google. Easily pushing some boundaries especially with, I think their video is very good and notebook LM with podcasting also ~is,~ is extremely [00:17:50] good.\n\nThere's sort of elements there that are really good that Google do that. Which Chad, GPD doesn't, or even Claude doesn't in terms of context size, ~the,~ the amount of data that [00:18:00] Google is able to handle is way more than its nearest competitor by a long shot. So in that respect, you know, Gemini is a, ~is ~is a pro [00:18:10] account worth having.\n\nSo we've got Claude, we've got. Gemini, we use perplexity. We think ~that ~that is a really good one, especially with deep research. Grok is pretty good [00:18:20] by Twitter because it's uncensored. So for example, my dad recently went through an angiogram and got an angioplasty and, you know, we [00:18:30] were trying to decipher his reports.\n\nChad GPT wouldn't but Grok did, which was useful. ~You know, at,~ at the time it was useful because that's exactly what [00:18:40] happened. ~I did not have a Grok Pro account and then I got, I actually bought it at the hospital and it was very useful to like, you know, look at the reports and click the picture and say, can you tell me what's going on?~\n\n~Rather than wait for someone to tell us, and even. Give us some, you know, twisted version of what the fruit really is. So that, that's useful in terms of UNC censorship, you know, and I think I, I,~ I actually don't know where the line is with UNC censorship. I don't feel qualified enough to talk about that in terms of ai, but I do feel that [00:18:50] data is like super important.\n\nSo the amount of the data that. The AI is trained on, or the context that you give the AI is a [00:19:00] huge piece of the results you're gonna get. So there's different things, and I think what the key for everyone listening is what is your use case? [00:19:10] So right now, I would ask you to first go and make a list of the 10 activities you do most often in the week.\n\nJust [00:19:20] make a list of what they are. And then find out what process you use to get there and then see in that process, if you can augment that with ai and that [00:19:30] will be way more productive for anyone listening than any tool I give you right now.\n\nMatt Alder: ~Yeah, of course, of course. Makes perfect sense. Final question. Tell us about your book.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. The book is a, is a second of two. The first book is Amplify, which is how to. Use a podcast to grow a business. And the second book is Amplify Ai. Funny enough you know, the story of how the book is named is, is crazy because I didn't think of this name. AI told me to name it this, and once it came up with the name, I was like, of course it makes so much sense.~\n\n~But you know, it was right in front of me and I didn't even this book is, is, is all about augmentation of intelligence. It's about the reduction of human cognitive load. So. You see, you talk, you talk to people these days and you, you hear about how they are anxious or overwhelmed or burnt out, or there's all these, there.~\n\n~The, the human cognitive load is at its peak as like it, we, we feel constantly that we're missing something that we're, we're supposed to be doing in general. So the book. The book would've taken five years to write. And it is just a combination of so much including how a business can use AI to grow operations, revenue, brand, and audience.~\n\n~That's the second, the third part of the book the first part of the book is how to see intelligence, and I've used indigenous wisdom. Algorithms that have existed in nature, like bird patterns and ecosystems to inform how to create AI going forward that are collaborative in nature. And the middle part of my book, part two, is about an, it's about ethical use of AI and how.~\n\n~What to think about when you're using ai. And I know most of us right now are talking about AI and are looking for use cases, but obviously there's an ethical boundary that we've gotta talk, we've gotta talk about people's data is at stake people's, I suppose. IP in a way is at stake, but how much of that IP really belongs to us is a, is a big case that I'd like to make at some point.~\n\n~So I feel like the book is basically a a, a map for businesses on how to grow those four things, revenue, operations, brand and audience, and and also a way to think about ai. In a way that is useful for us going forward. Yeah.~\n\nMatt Alder: Fantastic Ronsley. Thank you very much for talking to me.\n\nRonsley Vaz: Ah, it's been a pleasure. Thanks Matt."

And if you've ever seen anyone use models in the way they describe things and the way they sell and the way they portray how they do their work, then it's probably a Simon bone invention. So he's the host of the wisdom of new into the podcasting game.\r\n\r\nI, I suppose, considering all things considered, but the brains on this man is something that I am very jealous of, and I hope that when I grow up, I am somewhere close to a Simon Bowen. So, Simon, thank you for joining us. This has been really cool. Look, it's an absolute pleasure. I wanna start with this models, I, you know, concept.\r\n\r\nAnd I feel like everyone these days have some sort of models primarily because it is such a simple way to explain what you do. Can you give us a, a, breakdown of what that means? I mean, I feel like I'm butchering that idea, but maybe you have a [00:01:00] better way to explain what the model's method is.\r\n\r\nSure. Can I draw\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: a model to explain that? Would that be a Yes? You can. Okay. So, you know, when we think about how people communicate, look, first of all, let me actually just say right up front, particularly for people in business, okay. When we use the word system in business, you know, generally people think about your sales system or your finance system or whatever.\r\n\r\nThe two most important systems in any business are the system for thinking. The system for influence. So the system for thinking is the quality of the idea on which the business is built. A business is only as good as the idea on which it's built and the quality of the leaders running that business.\r\n\r\nAnd then the system for influence is your ability to influence the choices people make customers to buy from you staff to work hard for you, suppliers to serve you banks, to fund you, regulators, to let you operate. And so you know it. When we have a robust system for thinking and [00:02:00] influence, we have the ability to think deeper than everybody else.\r\n\r\nI, I'd love people to write this down. Depth of thinking is the only true market differentiation there actually is. When you go to market with a deeper thought around the problem you solve than anybody else, you are automatically differentiated. Right. But we've bought into this marketing story that is, well, the customer knows what they want, ask them and give it to them.\r\n\r\nThat is actually not true. Now, in, a medical setting, like a doctor is a salesperson, they have to get you to say, have surgery or go into a treatment plan or something like that. I had a pretty catastrophic back injury that you know about. And you know, when the surgeon's saying, you need surgery, Simon, everything in my mind is going, don't, you're not operating on my back.\r\n\r\nRight. And if he'd asked me what I wanted, I would've just said, let's do some physio. And I probably would've been in a wheelchair or walking with a frame. But he said, you need surgery and this is why. And I've had about a 98% recovery. So [00:03:00] oftentimes the customer actually, if the customer doesn't know what is available.\r\n\r\nHow can they inform you about what they want and in a complex sale? So if we think about what is a complex sale, A complex sale is, you know, when there's you, you have this ability to solve a problem in a way that other people don't understand. And then there's them, the customer, now they have whole chunks of their world over here that they're not telling you about.\r\n\r\nIt's private to them. Their preferences, their priorities, their affordability et cetera, et cetera. Their fears, their concerns, and you have a whole chunk of stuff over here that you know about that they don't know about. And so the only bit that really matters when we are saying, oh, we'll find out what the customer wants and just give it to them is this bit in the middle in, because they already know that.\r\n\r\nI mean, they already understand that bit and you understand that bit. There is no value in here ' cause it's just labor for hire. There's [00:04:00] no insight, there's nothing new. There's no but when you can say, Hey, if you were to have a problem out here, I'm not saying you do, but if you were to have a problem out here this thing here could fix that.\r\n\r\nDo you want to know more? That's called the complex sale, right? And so we've traditionally used words only to sell to the world industrial. I call it industrial age selling. It came from foot in the door selling. In 1966, these two guys did a study into what they called the Yes ladder. Like get the customer to say yes.\r\n\r\nYou get the customer to do one small thing, they do another slightly bigger thing. And door to door salespeople used to wear shoes that had the sole of the shoe was wider than the actual foot of the shoe, so that once the door was open, they could put the foot in the door and the customer could keep slamming the door on your foot and they couldn't get the door shut.\r\n\r\nNow you can keep shouting your pitch at the customer inside the door, and it's fundamentally, you and I have a real alignment on the need for, you know, more noble business and enterprise. [00:05:00] But this is a fundamentally disrespectful way of selling, right? A very confront, even the word pitch, right sales pitch.\r\n\r\nA pitch is what a pitcher in baseball does to get the batter out. Why do we use the word pitch, right? You think about all the language, right close. it's the opening of a relationship, but we close them and all of this sort of business. So generally, the gift of the gab, someone that can just talk you in to a sale, right?\r\n\r\nAnd so we've relied heavily on language only. And the problem with that is if we think about humans and we use words only to communicate with people, that is a red zone down here. And when you use words only people say, well, I hear you. But it's all just noise. Anyone that's had teenage kids knows this world super well, right?\r\n\r\nYeah, I hear you. But like, could you tidy up your room, please? I get that. So that, to me, that means sometime this month, right? I heard you, but it's actually just noise, right? and [00:06:00] interestingly, only about 11% of the information that the human brain brings in from the world outside comes in through the auditory channels, through the ears.\r\n\r\nOnly 11% about 3% is taste, 1% is smell. I think about three or something percent is touch. So that leaves, it leaves. About 83% of the information's world comes in through the optic nerve. 55% of the brain's reflex reaction is attached directly to the optic nerve. And so if we can increase the visual access to our ideas for people.\r\n\r\nIf we can show it to them rather than tell it to them, we move up into this top quadrant where people say, well, I see. And what I see is always more interesting than what I hear. Remember, that soccer team of boys that got stuck in the cave in Thailand? Yes. And the cave was gonna flood. Right. And I heard that news story on the radio in the car when it first broke out.\r\n\r\nAnd I've gotta admit, I'm thinking, well, you walked in, walk out before the floods come. I don't get it. Like you walked into the cave walk out. [00:07:00] So I heard it didn't connect. Then I saw the, you know, the picture on TV of, oh well this is what the cable Oh, okay. So much more interesting. On the other side of that, if we can increase structural, what I call structural access, so the human brain is a meaning making machine and people wanna make sense of.\r\n\r\nWhat you are talking about. They don't just wanna be told this will solve your problem. The next question is, Hey, this thing would solve your problem over here. Okay, well I need to make sense of that. What is the structure of that? When we give people structural access, they move over to this side where they're basically saying why I get it?\r\n\r\nAnd that's believable because it has structure. Now this model that I'm drawing for you at the moment is a model that I made up, but because it's a model, it's more believable than if I was just talking about this stuff right now. I've put some data in there and, but I built the model, And then in the top right corner up here where people say, Hey, listen, I see and it's interesting and I [00:08:00] get it, and it's believable.\r\n\r\nwhere I see and I get it, it becomes desirable. And so that by itself is interesting. what we added to the models, which is really I think where we took models to another level, we exposed this super green zone up in the top right quadrant. And what just happened then, by the way, is what I call a punchline.\r\n\r\nA punchline is when you walk people through some scenarios and paradigms and then you open up a conversation they didn't see coming. There's this super green zone, this secret zone in the model where if we add great choreography to this The way we walk through the model, and I base that on stage magic and comedy, which are the two performing arts, designed to create curiosity, which is the most powerful state to put somebody into if you're trying to influence them by desirable becomes viable.\r\n\r\nAnd you don't, need to resort to industrial age selling false pressure, scarcity, urgency. You just show people what is actually going on. So for example, I could wrap this [00:09:00] very quickly as a sale if I want to do that and say, so do you want me to show you how to sell in the top right corner of that matrix?\r\n\r\nAnd if you do sign up here, you know, this is what we're doing, blah, blah, blah. This is how we make that happen. And in one model, I've just taken everything else out of play that they might be doing and shift 'em the top right quadrant. So the way we communicate. And we're taught to communicate in school.\r\n\r\nIt just has huge gaps all the way through it, right? Yeah. And so as soon as you start drawing, you draw people in. When you give them a visual model, they get visual access. It's interesting when you put structure to it. And by the way, this item one, item two, item three, item four, that's not a model, that's a list shown visually.\r\n\r\nThis is also not a model, that's a list shown as a visual diagram. what makes this a model is when you actually articulate the dimensions of the model, you talk about the interactions between the parts, you [00:10:00] actually use dimensionality. Direction through the model. And, have a method and showing people why the geometry actually matters.\r\n\r\nAnd so a lot of people go , I've got a model and they show me, you know, three circles with words. And I go, that's not a model, right? What is it? An inward moving circle or an outward moving circle? And what's happening on this line? And what's happening on that line? So why is it three circles, one inside the other?\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't it look like this?\r\n\r\nLike explain that to me. You know, or people will go, you know, I've got this model where, you know, go from A to B and I go, great, explain the arrow. You didn't label the arrow, you didn't tell me what the arrow's there for. Like, people bring models to me all the time and I'm going, it's not a model.\r\n\r\nSo when you think about structure and giving people structural access, that's what the geometry actually does. So if I can steal a little bit more time and then let you ask another question. The other reason for this is if we, humans are interesting, humans have an intensity about them from high to low.\r\n\r\nAnd when we want to influence people, we are gonna apply a certain amount of time and [00:11:00] energy to try and influence them. And what we know for certain is that humans have a naturally high intensity for resistance.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: They have a hardwired system for saying no. Right? And they have a low intensity for acceptance.\r\n\r\nWe do not have an automatic system for saying yes. And the proof of is simple. You know, you go into a shop, someone says, may I help you? You go, no thanks. Just look. Right? And then three minutes later you'll go up to that shopper system while they're talking to somebody else and interrupt 'em and go, do you have one of these?\r\n\r\nRight? Or someone says, Ronsley, that's amazing. You are incredible. Thank you. And you go, it's nothing. 'cause we're not good at acceptance, right? in selling conversion is the moment these curves. Reverse conversion is when the resistance curve collapses and the acceptance curve rises. That's when conversion occurs.\r\n\r\nNow the payment is out here, but the conversion to the idea, to the value occurs [00:12:00] first. And so in order to make that happen with the least amount of time and effort people get in here to try and make that happen sooner. And they use false scarcity, urgency and pressure. They pressure sell. Now, if you put pressure inside a closed vessel, you just push the side further apart.\r\n\r\nYeah. I happen to discover that if I put a visual model in front of somebody, this is me, this is them, and I put a visual model on 'em, and we work together on the model. The model does the convincing, the model does the heavy lifting. It's not me to them, it's me and them working together on a model\r\n\r\nThe model becomes the idea that they can buy, and there's a reason for that. And then that positions me on the other side out here where instead of selling, I can just facilitate. So once I've got them. To the idea. Now I can just facilitate what this looks like to buy from us. So you want that model.\r\n\r\nGreat. But let's work out how we could make this happen together. And the reason this shift where you get the model to do the [00:13:00] heavy lifting, what you really do is you're making the model, the mediator between two people. And once, you know, two people often don't reach agreement on something, but two people that have a mediator in between do, and you make the model, the mediator and the model does the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nAnd so we can both pour in on the model together. And if they fill in parts of the model with their words, I'm gonna use their words, not mine. It's hard for people to disagree with a model that they helped to build. Right? And so, you know, it's a medium for thinking and bring people along on the thinking journey.\r\n\r\nAnd then for influence, so. Slightly long explanation, but it's why models work. They are a system for thinking and influence.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: That is an episode in itself. I, it's just absolutely, you know, like you mentioned, the depth of thinking there is insane. And I want to actually really want to get into how you think, because I think that's, that's a very, for me, that would be selfish.\r\n\r\nBut you mentioned some, a couple of things that I wanna talk about. [00:14:00] Firstly, the reflexes on the optic nerve. Yeah. I would not have my left eye if the reflexes on my optic nerve was not connected. 'cause I was walking up the Glasshouse Mountains for a climb and Mount gon, and I did not see that someone broke off a branch and I was walking.\r\n\r\nAnd I, I wouldn't have, like, there's no way that Ronsley could see that, but my eye was so quick and it shot at the right time. But that, that broken stick went Yeah. Into the eyelid instead of the eye. And I can totally attest to this optic nerve being like the reflexes that Yeah. You know, it's absolutely spot on.\r\n\r\nYeah. The second thing that you mentioned that I feel like the rest of the podcast should be dedicated to is communication. Sure. I feel like that is the key to everything, in my opinion. Whether we communicate to people the way you are or we communicating to artificial intelligence, we want to be able to communicate in the right way to get the [00:15:00] results that we are after.\r\n\r\nSo. Let's go down that path, if you don't mind. Sure. Yeah. And let's talk about communication. How have you seen, I mean, you've been obviously very good at communicating thoughts, ideas depth of thinking is ridiculous. You know, I thought I had depth of thinking, but listening to you for the first 20 minutes was like, whoa, you know, I have so much to learn.\r\n\r\nSo when you've been using ai, how have you been able to communicate what you want? What has your experience been like?\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: actually I have a great little story about ai. That's only just happened this week, by the way. Yeah, totally. Friends of ours have an elderly mother who's on an oxygen machine. And the oxygen machine stopped working on the weekend.\r\n\r\nAnd really all you can do when that happens is call an ambulance and get them to come out as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nBut our friends jumped into chat. He has the side button on his phone, set up to run chat. He jumped in the chat and said. My mother's oxygen machine has stopped working. Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nChad said, what brand is the machine and what model? And he told it and it said, okay, here's some things you can [00:16:00] do. And it gave him a hack using items from the kitchen and a sponge and freezer space and things like that to keep her being fed with oxygen until the ambulance arrived. AI probably saved a life, but ai, what machine?\r\n\r\nGive me the model and everything. So here's something you and it came up with all these suggestions. Go figure. So the world's changed, right? And I think one of the ways a lot of people see AI and you know, I think generally speaking, when people think ai, they think chat you. And I know AI is so much more than that.\r\n\r\nIn fact, AI's had a long tail. It's been around for much longer than people realize. It just launched in November 22, I think, into a form that most people get their hands on. And so people become a bit obsessed about be becoming prompt engineers. So let's just talk about the chat tools becoming prompt engineers to get good quality output out of chat.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I do before I ask chat to do something is draw a [00:17:00] model. I literally just hand draw a model and put it into chat and explain the model to chat, and then I ask it to do the task. And I get significantly higher quality output out of it than I do from any written prompt. Sometimes these days I'll draw a model, put it in the chat and say, could you write me an email about that?\r\n\r\nAnd it just spits out incredible stuff. And then I take it and put some wisdom juice over it. So the problem with AI is it's a large language model. Mm-hmm. And it's not a large insight model. And so the problem is that, you know, we've got now got more noise than we've ever had before, and communication is a human activity.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Mm-hmm.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: If you think about it, you're communicating with another human to influence them. You've done some thinking. Here's something you'd like to make happen. Now you need to influence some other people. Right? So communication is a human activity. Increasingly AI [00:18:00] can manage some of that communication.\r\n\r\nyou know, I, I think about, AI in terms of where is the AI line? So the technology line, and let's just say today that's the AI line had, you know, has things above the line and below the line. Now, typically anything that is below the tech line amounts to human replacement.\r\n\r\nSo the industrial age was a form of technology. The tech line came from the industrial age and it replaced human labor, right? But everything above that tech line should be human enhancement. And of course, as that line rises. It wipes out all the human stuff that falls below it and makes that replaceable, right?\r\n\r\nOr, you know, if we think about things like conscience, compassion, context communication, I would've said in, a lot of communication was above the line. You know, with AI agents and things like that, that now is potentially falling [00:19:00] below the line. You know, connection. These are things that above the line, but concepts, constructs.\r\n\r\none of the things that is still above the line is contrast. It's still a human notion to think about. What is it not? So, you know, if you're putting some marketing stuff into chat, for example, to come up with some marketing ideas, seldom does chat give you information back that says it is not this, which is useful stuff to talk to people about.\r\n\r\nRight. Content, all these things now are below the line. if you work in this world, you've gotta figure out how to get into this world.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Mm-hmm. And of\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: course we all know the existential debate about conscience and compassion and all of these sorts of things, but you know, the AI line is moving all the time.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the things that we need to understand about the technology line is it never stops and it never goes away. 'cause humans are inventive. We keep creating. And so, you know, we need to figure out how to use these tools in a responsible and powerful way. But I know that if I do my [00:20:00] thinking first and then pop a model in front of, an AI tool. I get a much more solid body of work outta that. Now, I'm not sure you would know this better than I, but I heard somewhere that the estimate is that AI would've consumed all human created content by 2026 or seven or something ridiculous like\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: that.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: Well, if that's the case, everyone's gonna sound the same.\r\n\r\nThere's gonna be lots and lots of noise. There already is, and everyone's gonna sound the same. And so this is particularly true, important for founders. How do you let this part of you show up? Yeah, and of course, we do that through this thing that we call the genius model. We, capture the genius of a company in a single model that you can explain in seven minutes that contains the founder's originality inside that model, and then go from there.\r\n\r\nif you taught me to treat chat as a like to have a collaboration with it, right. And have a conversation with it. And then I went, well I'm gonna pump models in there 'cause that's how I [00:21:00] see and hear the world. Right? Yeah. And turns out chat quite likes that. And so does Claude and all these others, right?\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, these days, the very first thing it does when I pump a model in there is give me a breakdown of the model of how it's understood it. So chat's first action is to give me feedback on this is what I think you've just said to me. Explain to me. Now that's useful to know. Does it even have the context?\r\n\r\nSo, you know, communication is a human thing and we probably should talk about human to human communication as well as human to chat. But I fear that we're becoming lazy communicators. I. As we have these AI tools and people want the hacks and give me the library of prompts, and what that's doing is it's, diminishing people's capacity to think through what they wanna say before they say it.\r\n\r\nSo think about it like this, if all you use is a library of prompts that other people created, you are not exercising your mind to be a [00:22:00] creative communicator. You're just exercising your mind to be a cut and paste communicator and creative communicators run the world. Yeah. And so you, you know, learning to use ai, you know, really should challenge everyone to be the best possible communicator they can be.\r\n\r\nBecause, you know, AI is not emotional. And it doesn't read between the lines either. So you kind of Yeah. You know, become a creative communicator, not a cut and paste communicator. and the tools become so much more powerful. Yeah. and we all only do two things. Ronsley in business, every founder that's ever launched a product or service, there's only done one of two things, or both of them created or curated.\r\n\r\nThat's it. Mm-hmm. That's the sum total of business. And we've turned that into a product that only does two things. It makes the customer safe and it helps 'em win. The two things we're all selling is make the customer safe. Everyone wants to be made safe. No one wants to behave safely, like they wanna drink too [00:23:00] much or drive too fast, or smoke cigarettes or whatever, but they want someone else to make them safe.\r\n\r\nSo, make me safe and help me win. Help me get a better result than most other people get. in this context. So every business that's ever been built, created or curated or did both to make a solution that makes the customer safe and helps them win in the context of the problem a customer has. And so, you know, we, need to be creative communicators.\r\n\r\nAnd so my first objective when I'm dealing with, you know, when I'm communicating with AI, is to create or curate a model that lets it understand what I want it to do. And then, go from there. there's a few other dimensions to this when you're dealing directly with a human or in one-to-one, one to many.\r\n\r\nBut, you know, we just, we've turned communication into an industry and yet, you know, we've missed so many of the basics as we've done that."

    "transcript": "# AAI139 Simon Bowen\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] with communication, I feel like it's such a, topic that is not talked about, even though there's so much of information available, so many people doing podcasts, so many people putting out content on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nBut yesterday I drew a model, well I drew a, a sketch of how I wanted a YouTube thumbnail to look like, I dunno whether you saw that post, but I drew a sketch and I said, here, I want the subject and here I want the content. I want you to make sure that the subject is highlighted and put a relevant background.\r\n\r\nI just drew it on the iPad, put that in, and I took a picture of myself and I said, here's the topic and the thumbnail. If you have a look on, on Facebook. I just, I, I shared that yesterday. It's absolutely insane. And it's crazy 'cause you just mentioned how it understands models better. So what we thought was not possible.\r\n\r\nWhen AI came along, we thought all the creative work would be the last to go. Somehow all the creative work is the [00:01:00] first to go. And when you are talking about these depth of thinking to be able to, to explain to someone, Hey, this is where you could feel safe. I feel like that is something that is not explored.\r\n\r\nI feel that is lacking in communication. 'cause we are all going after a template or to your point, pressure or, or lack of scarce or scarcity to sell rather than, Hey, you are a intelligent human being. You've, you know, started a business. And in my case, the clients that we have are very, they, they care about delivery more than they care about attract and convert.\r\n\r\nSo they're not really good at attract and convert. they're good at delivery and they kind of, you know, a, a founder is either good at one. One of the three. Very rarely are they good at two of the three. So they have to learn the other two. And they go, oh, I'm the best kept secret in my industry.\r\n\r\nAnd that's primarily because like myself was complicating the communication. 'cause I'm like, Hey, you gotta know all these things that I [00:02:00] know, but you don't need to know all the things that I know. So how do you draw that boundary? Like I'm, I'm sure you have a way to explain that in a, sensible way to sort of communicate.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to know all these things. You just have to know this so you can feel safe and you can win.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: Yeah. So I often use this framing of out think outsell, OutServe. Out think outsell OutServe, it sounds like the TV show survivor, right?\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Mm-hmm.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: But. Out think the marketplace. What does that actually mean?\r\n\r\nyou need to be able to demonstrate to the market that you get it, better than anybody else. You get them better than anybody else, and you've got them better than any anybody else. You've got their back. They're gonna be safer with you than they will than anyone else. I coined this term buyer safety.\r\n\r\nIt's the five key levels of buyer safety. If you build your marketing funnel with buyer safety in mind, every step of the marketing process should make that prospect feel [00:03:00] safer with you than without you. So the safest thing for them to do is actually have a conversation with you. Most marketing funnels are making the prospect feel less safe every step of the way.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: But\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: when you create true safety. The safest thing for them to do is have a conversation with you. When you get it, they get a sense, you've got more knowledge about this topic than anyone else. You get them, you really actually understand them and their world, and you've got their back. You've got them, and so we've gotta separate message from mechanics, right?\r\n\r\nAnd so much of the confusion is created by the mechanics. And so you've gotta run the funnels. You've gotta, you know, you've you've gotta have click through and you've gotta have all this stuff set up and all this tech connect and the mechanics, right? And people will get so enamored with the mechanics\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: that\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: not enough emphasis is placed on the simplicity of the message.\r\n\r\nWhat makes a message work is, so when Einstein started working out the general theory of relativity,\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: he\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: had [00:04:00] four blackboards of formula, and then he simplified it to e equals mc squared. And then he told the world about it. And it became the underlying basis of physics, right? The general theory of relativity.\r\n\r\nBut he spent years simplifying the message. And so we complicate the mechanics and we let that complication bleed into the message. And so we start to complicate the message, right? So we need to outthink the marketplace. And generally that's through simplification. The greatest form of sophistication that exists is actually simplification.\r\n\r\nAnd there's a world of difference between dumbing down versus simplifying. Do not treat your market as stupid. Don't dumb down, simplify, and, you know, stop treating your market as victims and start treating them as heroes in their own journey. this is the interesting If you treat your prospect as the hero, who do you become?\r\n\r\nSo the guide, well, yeah, the guide, the saves. Luke's, Luke, the Skywalker, right? Is the hero of the story. No doubt. And then he goes and meets Yoda and he's not listening. [00:05:00] So Yoda says, pick up your lightsaber. Luke can come at me. Luke goes, I'll hurt you master. He goes, no, you won't just have a go. And, Luke comes at him.\r\n\r\nI'm not a star Wars super fan, but I remember the scene and he goes, and Yoda disarms him. Oh, that's interesting. So Luke gets a little bit cranky. He has another go. And Yo Yoda disarm. Now he's angry and he's really going at it. Yo Yoda shuts his eyes and, and you know, Luke could have been killed kind of thing.\r\n\r\nAnd he goes, I don't understand. And Yoda just goes, it's the force, Luke, simplified message. It's the force, right? When you make the client the hero, and we don't talk about the ideal avatar in our world. We talk about the hero client. When you make the client the hero, you become the sage and everybody wants the sage.\r\n\r\nAnd a sage has three things. A sage has profound genius. And that means they can simplify the most complex things. And they don't sell from ego, they sell from wisdom. And so profound genius, right? The sage has powerful, calm, they don't create pressure, they actually calm things down, powerful, [00:06:00] calm. Think about the concept of that.\r\n\r\nIf you can show up in a way that just creates powerful, calm, and then the sage has practical simplicity. So in our world, we turn complex things into visual models. So it creates a practical and simple way of understanding this profound wisdom that they're actually sharing. So be the sage. Make your clients the hero.\r\n\r\nwhile you are trying to be the hero to your client, they have to be the victim, and it makes them the worst kind of clients. So stop making them the victim, exit the hero space and let them become the hero, and you be the sage. Now, interestingly. So this is all on the front end. Interestingly, if we think about this, when you just sell products and services, you're at the bottom of the, of the pyramid and you're in a price-based market.\r\n\r\nIf you, you know, the hero would be here, and if you're the hero to the client, you know you're offering strength, that's a good thing. But if you vacate, but that makes the client the victim, if you vacate the hero space, they can become the hero and you become the sage at [00:07:00] the top. The next thing I'm about to share is going to upset a lot of people, right?\r\n\r\nWhen you vacate the hero space and become the sage, the client can become the hero. This space in the middle is absolutely no man's land. It's the world of free information. It's entirely commoditized. And this level is called thought leadership. No one should ever call themselves a thought leader because true thought leaders never do call themselves thought leader.\r\n\r\nRight? And to be a thought leader, you need two things. You need original thinking, you need followers. If you've got original thinking, but no followers, you're just a great thinker, but you're not influencing anybody if you've got a bunch of followers, but you, it's not original thinking. You're a great teacher and influencer, but you're not a thought leader.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah,\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: right. And so thought leadership has turned into, Hey, would I'd love to have a coffee and pick your brains? Could you share that free info with And it's a completely commoditized space. It's actually below. It's better off to be the hero for the client and do a done for you solution than trying to be a thought leader doing a done with you solution.\r\n\r\nRight. Because people [00:08:00] will pay for strength. But if you can vacate that space and, become the sage and let the client be the hero, you can still do some done for you, but you have to bring this profound genius, powerful, calm, and practical simplicity to the table so they know without any shadow of a doubt they're experiencing something rare and unique in the way you show into the market.\r\n\r\nThen outsell is being able to explain value rapidly, visually, structurally, give them access to the value, and the sale is the first step in serving out serve the marketplace. There's some really interesting data that says 53% of customer loyalty is formed in the purchasing process, so over half the customer's loyalty is formed as they buy from you.\r\n\r\nSo the way you sell is one of the most powerful predictors of the level of customer loyalty. So if you don't sell well, you'll have buyer's remorse. But if you do sell well, you'll have [00:09:00] buyer safety. Yeah. And you'll have a high level of customer loyalty. Now it's yours to lose rather than build.\r\n\r\nAnd so when we use false scarcity and urgency in old pressure based sales techniques, you'll create buyer's remorse. You're not gonna create loyalty. So how you sell is basically is code for how you communicate.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Yeah. Is\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: the biggest predictor of customer loyalty and you know, but just commoditizing so rapidly.\r\n\r\nNow, interestingly, if I draw a black line across here, and we call that the AI line. Well, AI has consumed product, AI has consumed thought leadership already, and it's probably about halfway through the hero level. Yes, it's gonna struggle a lot more with the top of the pyramid. It might, but I reckon it's about there right now.\r\n\r\nSo if you are living in this world, kind of watch out,\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: you know? Mm-hmm. Oh, Simon, every time I ask you a question, I think I have got more questions to ask and I don't even know there's enough time to sort of cover, so I'm gonna ask this question and I'd love to land the plane at the same time Sure.\r\n\r\nBecause off [00:10:00] time. But, you know, I, I feel like I can have this conversation with you and we've had these conversations that have gone on like for hours. But I feel like, you know, communication, leadership. Decision making, they're kind of all, you know, in this. Yeah. Like you talk about those CS up the top.\r\n\r\nRight. AndI talk about courage, collaboration, and connection. Yeah. Yeah. As the human traits. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like what AI has done, especially to these founders who are very delivery focused and, you know, don't, I mean not really good at attract and convert, is AI allows them to be courageous.\r\n\r\nThey all the excuses that they had before kind of go out the window and they can exercise their human focus of courage. or trait of courage rather than worrying about content or these other things that, you know, don't sort of, you know, are being commoditized [00:11:00] now. ladies and gentlemen, by the way, the simon [bowen.com](http://bowen.com/) is where you go to find all the cool stuff that Simon's up to, including his podcast and you know where to find more about him.\r\n\r\nThe simon [bowen.com](http://bowen.com/), all that will be in the show notes. And the links will be there and all his work will be there. I'm a huge fan of Simon, so I consume a lot of his work. I highly suggest you do the same. But Simon, when your thinking about this and you're kind of going, if you had to give advice to these people based on all your knowledge, how would you recommend us start to look at as at business differently when these new factors have come into play?\r\n\r\nLike AI and the tech line that you spoke about?\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: Yeah, so I believe business is one of the most powerful forces for good on the planet in the hand of the right leaders. And you talked about leadership and courage. I'd love to land it in this space, right? If business is one of the most powerful forces for good on the planet, selling as the start of the service process, [00:12:00] selling as the start of serving should be the most noble thing any business does.\r\n\r\nSelling should be the most noble thing any business does, and what business is really doing for people is addressing this interesting space through here, which I'll come back to in a minute and I'm gonna land this. In terms of leadership, all progress\r\n\r\nlives on the far side of chaos. And so when you sell a product or service to a custom, you are trying to help them make progress. They can't make that progress 'cause they're stuck inside their status quo and their status quo is, I understand exactly what the patterns are inside my world, but those patterns are not delivering this result that I want.\r\n\r\nAnd so I can't get to the result. I can't make progress 'cause I'm stuck inside my status quo, which is, you know, other language for comfort zone. And I don't want to go outside my comfort zone. But to get outside my comfort zone, I've gotta go through chaos now. Chaos. It looks like it doesn't have patterns, but it actually does.\r\n\r\nYou [00:13:00] know, I started studying what's the most random thing I could think of 'cause I want to observe the patterns. Primarily. I'm a pattern finder and I thought luck, you know, let's see if luck has patterns. Turns out it does. And to prove it, you know, we started entering competitions and sweepstakes, you know, win a car, win a trip, stuff like that.\r\n\r\nAnd television in Australia. Put my wife on TV regularly. They call her Australia's competition queen. We've won well over a million dollars worth of prizes, trips, and two family trips to Disney World in Florida. Two family trips to London, trips into state, walking over the top of the Sydney Harbor Bridge cars.\r\n\r\nAt one point, one of the current affairs shows said, can you put everything you've won in one room? We wanna, the journalists are gonna come out and interview and we walked around the house and just about everything we had like the TVs my daughters. One, all of their game consoles and push bikes.\r\n\r\nAnd our middle daughter said, my bike's too small. We said, win another one. So she did. We win with volition and if we teach people what to do, 'cause there are patterns to this, if we teach people what to do, they'll often win a trip within about three [00:14:00] months. There's absolutely patterns to this stuff. Luck is not random.\r\n\r\nthere's a degree of randomness, but it's far from as random as people think. Right? There's even patterns in the lottery. I, I downloaded 20 years of lottery winnings in an Excel file from the Lottery's website and got a biomedical statistician friend of mine to find the patents. He said, absolutely, but you won't win if you use the same numbers every week.\r\n\r\nYou've gotta use different numbers because of the way the patterns run. And so people look at chaos and go, there's no patterns there, but there absolutely are. It's just that they, can see the chunks, but they can't see the connections. What makes a pattern is actually the connections, not the pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd so people kind of, people go into chaos. They go, oh, it feels bad. And they zip back into comfort zone and they move into chaos a little bit and they zip back into comfort zone. It's called spinning on the edge of, the comfort zone, right? But out here is progress. This is what they want, but I feel really comfortable in here.\r\n\r\nAnd so someone's gotta shove them into the [00:15:00] comfort zone. So they stumble far enough to get into the progress zone and realize, oh, this is better. This line is the innovation line. Innovation isn't coming up with the idea. Innovation is applying the idea create, coming up with the idea innovation's, applying the idea.\r\n\r\nSo what is this line? This is the critical line. This is where leaders live. The job of a leader is to lead people into chaos safely. That's the job. A leader. Leader, if you are a sales person who's trying to be a leader, lead your customer into chaos safely. And there is a direct correlation between the courage of the leader and the comfort of the follower to follow them into chaos.\r\n\r\nAnd so a leader who displays real courage will have more people following 'em into chaos than the leader that does not. And so leaders understand that leaders are not interested in trying to blame the cause of the chaos. They actually just wanna address the [00:16:00] chaos. And so you think about the founders that you are talking about what they've done, like what does it mean to be a founder of a business?\r\n\r\nIt means you found the patterns in what other people see as chaos. That's all it means. You found the connections inside the chaos that gave you a pattern that allowed you to come up with a compelling and self-evident solution that you could take to the marketplace. And then you wonder why no one else gets it when you're trying to explain it.\r\n\r\nBecause when you just use words, they're going, well, that sounds chaotic. and you are, relying on them to trust your courage to walk into chaos. Right now, the moment you step back and while you are the primary salesperson, you can get away with it. But when you step back, your company grows.\r\n\r\nNow you've got a sales team. They don't have the leadership courage, and they're actually still trying to figure out the chaos. And so they don't sell as well. Capture in a model, put the courage into a model and get the model to make sense of chaos and then let your salespeople sell through the model.\r\n\r\nAnd now you can scale the business. [00:17:00] Spending money on fulfillment is over capitalization. If you haven't spent money on scaling the selling. The only way you can scale a business is scale the selling. And so you've gotta be able to have multiple generations of sales team sell like the founder and\r\n\r\nThe founder is the best salesperson only for two reasons. They intuitively understand the chaos and they have the right to cut whatever deal they want. If you give every salesperson the right to cut whatever deal they want, they'd all sell like crazy, right? But they don't have that, right? So you gotta capture the founder's courage and understanding of the chaos into a framework that you give other people to sell with.\r\n\r\nBut we live in a world now where it feels to people more like chaos than ever before. And you know, we need real leadership courage because. All progress lives on the far side of chaos. we don't have new chaos in the world. We just have chaos. We do, we've always had chaos. Entro. Chaos. Entropy\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: is, entropy has been existing since the beginning of time, right?\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah. It's the thing that makes, everything [00:18:00] work. Ladies and gentlemen, the simon [bowen.com](http://bowen.com/) is where you gotta find everything that Simon does. All those links will be in the show notes. Simon, this has been a little slice of heaven. Thank you so much. I wonder, and I was gonna ask this off air, but I think I'm gonna ask it on air, sounds like it's leading to something.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could do a regular monthly segment where you come on the show and we have this conversation around communication, courage, ai, if your time and your calendar allows it. But it's something that I thought about that I think that if I was to have a regular on the show, it would be Simon Bowen.\r\n\r\nSo something to think about. And you know, I really, really hope we see each other. I think Austin is probably the next place that we might get to bump into each other, but thank you so much for this. Thank you for all your wisdom. Thank you for actually helping me see that there is a, version of a founder that is so.\r\n\r\nMuch in their genius. and I love that. I, I [00:19:00] like to see that in you so that I can model that off you. So thank you so much. Love to Joanne. Pleasure. This was great.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: it's a pleasure. I'm sure we can find a rhythm for real conversations. You are one of the, small group of people who I can't as friends who also usually live in Australia, but we only ever see each other overseas.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: That's,\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: that's the world we're all living in right now. So thank you for having me on the show. And you know,I think we, live in a world now where we need to be willing to challenge people to, like we use the term founder, but we should be using the term leader.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: You know,\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: you've brought something compelling and self evident to the world.\r\n\r\nNow you need to display the courage and codify the genius and help people understand it. 'cause all progress is on the far side of chaos.\r\n\r\nRonsley Vaz: Love it. Thank you Simon.\r\n\r\nSimon Bowen: It's a pleasure."

    "transcript": "Claude Code\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] Good evening. It is 9:43 PM and I couldn't be more excited to record this video. Today we're gonna talk about Claude Code. It is deep coding at Terminal Velocity, is how they talk about it and they structure it and I can, oh, it's so exciting. Let me show you why this is such a cool thing. I've been coding for a while now.\n\nI've been sort of playing, but I've just installed Claude code and I wanna start installing the MCP servers and stuff like that. And I thought maybe I can record while this is happening. So. Firstly Claude code. this is for coders, right? And if you want to code at speed and like myself, this is amazing.\n\nSo first, install no js and then do NPM install minus, you just copy this and paste it into a terminal. But you've gotta actually have [00:01:00] node. JS installed for NPM to work, obviously. So they kind of have this, I love this, line here, deep coding at thermal velocity because it literally is, and you can build some really, really cool things and some amazing tools that already work with, Claude Code.\n\nAnd, you know, just look at the documentation to like, get into it because there's literally so many different use cases. And it works with your API so you can pay per thing or you, if you have pro or max accounts, then you can just connect cloud code to that and it will use.\n\nYour already existing accounts to, you know, as tokens for Claude Code. So I just wanna show you, so obviously I, I've been coding for a while. I, I'm building this for some, like for a client. I was looking at some of the code, but the team is building. But, you know, I got into Claude Code and I know noticed here, none of the MCP servers are [00:02:00] installed.\n\nSo if you go Claude, MCP. Again, if you don't know what MCP server, I basically connects, you know, everything to the world. so Claude, MCP minus MC, p minus, minus help is how you start. But C here, I mean. it gave me the same command back. obviously I didn't complete it.\n\nSo the best way to do this is say Claude MCP list. So what is currently on, so no current MCP service found. And I can use Claude MCP add to add a server, but in this list. You can import mpc, M-M-M-C-P servers from Claude Desktop. So I have a whole bunch of MCP servers installed on my desktop, and I wanna see if I can just import them without having to, you know, add and install them all the time.\n\nSo I'm gonna go Claude, [00:03:00] MCP, and then I'm gonna say add from Claude desktop. \n\nAnd \n\nit's found six MCP servers in cloud desktop, which is the MCP installer the server file system, puppeteer, MCP, YouTube perplexity Ask and Airbnb and it'll say, I ask me whether I wanna do, I say yes, and it has successfully imported.\n\nSo all I can do is go back and say MCP list and it should give me all. The different MCP servers that are connected. Now, actually what you should be doing is going and checking other MCP servers that you can connect. So if I just go and say MCP server Claude code. See what comes up. So the anthropic have their own cloud code [00:04:00] MCP servers.\n\nSo click on that. This is obviously the documentation for this and you can connect a whole bunch of things. So, I've connected the MCP server to install other MCP servers, which is that MCP installer. I've also connected. An MCP server. Look at my file system, an MCP server that is puppeteer, which actually sort of controls the mouse and does clicks and it access the puppeteer, literally what it means.\n\nOne for YouTube, which means I can kind of say, look at this video and give it a link inside Claude. And it'll go in for Airbnb to find in Airbnb but also for, where's that list Perplexity ask. So. Configuring MCP servers is obviously there's going into each MMCP server and, and seeing what the configs are is up to each MCP server for you to configure.\n\nBut I'm not gonna really get into that. [00:05:00] However, I am looking for MCP services is not actually what I'm looking for. \n\nI think this is a better way to say list of MCP servers.\n\nThat's what I'm looking for. So actually the one that I've gone to before, but there's other places that you can go and have a look and see what's worked and what's not worked. So, model, contact, service \n\nand and model context protocol. So you're looking for this GitHub that says MCP Service, but there's some other things here that maybe I'll look in into this and see what comes up. This is obviously new. I've not seen these before. These are different MCP servers, and \n\nthis is something that you know, sort of, aggregates them.\n\nSo I wanna look at featured just to see what are the ones here that are \n\nare \n\nreally. So there's obviously different ones that do different things and you can keep building your own. So if you're using Cursor or Windsurf, then you can install [00:06:00] those MCP here. If you dunno what that is, don't worry. So I want to go into that. Actually let me go back. And click on my, my GitHub original one. This is the one you're looking for. And in here there's a whole bunch of different servers.\n\nSo you can connect a Google Drive server, which let's maybe do that or the components, create a new Google Cloud project. Enable a Google drive, or this is more complicated than I thought. \n\nOnly because you've gotta create an authentication and all that kind of stuff. Let me just go back and find a simpler one. Obviously Slack, which is actually very powerful. Let see, I wanna do the AWS one \n\nSo come down and look at the MCP for AWS and you're try to look for how to install them, which means you wanna go down the list and I want to install I'll tell you which one. AWS bedrock is what I [00:07:00] want. Well, that's the bedrock knowledge base. For citation? see they've got so many MCB server, so it depends on what you actually \n\nactually \n\nwant. OnceLet me start by installing the documentation, AWS documentation, MCP server. So anytime I need any documentation from the MCP serverI don't need to do much, I just, it's already in here,\n\nSo I've obviously come to this point where I wonder whether I can just install it like. This and now you're seeing so let me see if Claude MCP add.\n\nSo what I would do in this situation is literally sort of copy this. Okay. And I will open, I don't know, board I suppose. And then in here I would say\n\nhere is my logs. Okay, \n\n[00:08:00] copy that. \n\nAnd then I will find this and I will say, Hey, this is. The part, so copy the link. I want to install this MCP server my inside my cloud installation. So here's what is really cool about having AI help you. Is that. You can literally ask for some of these things that when you get stuck and it's so powerful because I used to get to a point where, you know, I tried, tried so much and I would get stuck and it would be really hard to decipher what to do next.\n\nSo\n\nsee, it was really simple. I was missing. The quotes and I should have just put that in [00:09:00] quotes and it would've worked. I think so. So let me just see if that does work. \n\nSo, now it has the MCP server installed the latest config for all the AWS docs. So it now knows how to install AWS entirely. And if I go, okay, obviously this is all my projects, so if I go not all my projects, the new ones and you know, I would go and create a new project, open cloud code if I was gonna do like any development workInside the project, then I would open a new project and start, say, 'cause AWS is for secure data, secure hosting a whole bunch of different things that you can use it for. Now I have all the documentation inside cloud code. So then you can use that documentation to actually develop the develop or write the code in, in what a, the way AWS wants it actually.\n\nThat's very powerful. So, I don't know, I hope that was useful, but that's how you install [00:10:00] MCP servers and this is ronsley."

    "transcript": "WITH MATT ALDER\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] I think anyone in any capacity would be surprised at the speed at which it's happened. \n\nthis was just a theory. The blockchain was just a theory. You know, we had an idea of what could happen in a decentralized system. We didn't have fast enough computers. We didn't have, you know, that much data that we could store internet was not even fast enough.\n\nSo there's all these limitations that didn't allow or even allow us to conceptualize this far ahead. However, I. If you know the curve of adoption, not only adoption, but the curve of how much computing power you can fit into a small inch is a exponential curve. So this massive improvements that have happened over the last few years, I mean, when the first supercomputer got built, it almost was like someone ran the first four minute mile.\n\nIt just started to. You know, people started to break [00:01:00] those barriers, which were thought of as it was impossible, almost just 'cause the hardware could not support the theory. So yes, of course, 100%. It would be stupid not to say that anyone that would knew exactly that this was where we're headed.\n\nWe knew that in theory. But this quickly, I don't think so.\n\nAnd do you think that this sort of kind of incredible sort of pace of change, this curve, vertical curve we're going up with, is that sustainable? Are we likely to see the same kind of speed of development over the next five years? I think it is sustainable. I think the only thing that doesn't allow it to be sustainable is humans need for not wanting to change is probably the only thing that\n\nMatt Alder: Yeah. No, that's interesting.\n\nRonsley Vaz: yeah, that will come in the way. But in terms of. What is possible if you look at Industrial revolution and how much we do with machines already, but we don't even remember.\n\nWe just think it's normal. It's not normal to control the temperature of a room. we just take a lot of these things for granted. Yes, it is sustainable because [00:02:00] it's been gradually happening. It's just that we don't notice that it's happening.\n\nMatt Alder: Yeah, that's a kind of a stunning point actually, just in terms of how quickly we take things. for granted. I just wanted to get your view on there is so much hype about. Gen AI now, and agenda AI and agents and all this kind of stuff. Where's the line between hype and reality? Are things being overhyped? \n\nRonsley Vaz: it's an annoying. Goddamn line, especially for me hearing some people say really dumb stuff publicly, but it's the bro code of marketing, you know, to fake it till you make it. It's so, I don't know whether that part has changed. I think there's always gonna be a bunch of people that will take that and use all these fancy words.\n\nLike there are people, I actually watched a really good friend of mine and very well known entrepreneur, put out a post about, we just built three agents in the last half an hour. No, you did it. You built an assistant if that. It's a [00:03:00] big difference between assistant and an agent. And so maybe to clarify for people listening, an assistant is someone that you hand over a task to and you say and guide and hold hands with, and you get your solution.\n\nAn agent is, here's my task, get it done, and it'll find the best way to do it and do it with a checklist and create assistance to help. The agent achieve. So it's agentic behavior. It's hands off. \n\nso of course there's a hype. There's a hype, yes. And it's usually the marketers that are making the hype. I think the marketers are on one side making the hype, and then there's the media that's pulling everyone down.\n\nAnd there's somewhere in between, is the entrepreneur's way to, to find their own space in this world, because here's what's. This will easily be the biggest conversation of our lifetime. there's no debate on that. It's gonna change how we even educate our kids. Right. It's changed everything. \n\nMatt Alder: There is a kind of [00:04:00] a real sort of debate, a moment about how much, aI should or can do in the recruitment process. And I think that people are perhaps drawing the line in the wrong place. \n\nRonsley Vaz: I think if you understand how AI has come together, there's a, is a combination of neurology and psychology and physics and chemistry and math and computer science. There's so many, there's about eight or nine different fields that come together to create ai, the field and.\n\nComputers are built on us. It has long-term memory. It's got short-term memory just like us. It's got compute just like us. It's got neurons firing in certain ways just like us. So, you know, it's the only reason some of the things are not possible yet is because we've not found a way to articulate what that is. \n\nMatt Alder: What is it that people can be doing right now to kind of really get up to speed with what's possible to educate them themselves? How should people be experimenting? What kind of mindset is there? what do we all need to be [00:05:00] doing?\n\nRonsley Vaz: that's a very big question. I think just learning, just taking responsibility of the fact that, you know, this is a new skill that you might not have, and I. Just 'cause you get a response out of chat, GPT or any AI doesn't mean it's the right response. So there's an element of knowing what you're doing and how you are asking. being more responsible of how this works and where it works is probably the first thing. The second thing is not necessarily to look at the new AI tools or the new AI news that's coming out all the time, but to build on whatever value piece you bring to the table.\n\nSo if you've already spent. I think most people, you talk about the panic earlier, Matt and you, the panic comes from, oh, I've spent 20 years of my life doing this. What if it goes away? Rather than, oh, I've spent 20 years of my life [00:06:00] doing this. I know more about this, and if I augment that 20 years that I have of experience with this artificial silicon-based intelligence, I could potentially be untouchable,\n\nfrom aai 133\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] we're probably all using more AI than we know. And that's why it's even more important to have your voice and writing style.\n\nSo it's like, it differentiates. I can't tell you how many times I've used that again and again and again. It's just paying me huge dividends because I'll take all the writing from all these different apps and I'll just run it through that Scott Voice and it, people have said, wow, you know, this, this is so you, and it's, no, it's actually part of me, part of it's chat.\n\nGPT. Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate it because I. find that you know, for the last two and a half years, people like are using AI without doing it the right way. and actually even worse, people are selling that to others. And the ones who don't know any better just are sort of buying. if you know what you're doing. You can probably get as good if not much better results It's not about how quickly things are moving at all. It's about how quickly can you implement the things that you haven't been able to implement in your [00:01:00] business in the past. that's the simplest that I wanted to focus on . the only reason you're aware of all this new things in AI is because everyone's creating a new, newsletter or there's new content going out and you are involved in it.\n\nthese kind of breakthroughs have been happening in AI for ages. It's just that no, no one's known about it. It's, it was happening in a silo. So now that everyone's on top of it, it just feels like it's happening so quickly and don't get caught up in that. So don't get caught up in the new of open AI with agents that have been released yesterday and the day before yesterday.\n\nWITH CHARLSE GAUDET\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] I don't think that business owners should be focusing on how quickly AI is changing. I think they should be focusing on. the business goals that they have and how can they get that result?\n\nAnd you can get that result without the new technology that's coming out. Much, much better than you can trying to figure out a new technology if you are just learning ai, there's so much you don't know. . I meet people every week, who say, Ronsley, I am really good with ai. And then five minutes later they're like, oh, I didn't even know you could do that.\n\nAnd I'm like, that's basic. That's basic. Like, that is such a, that's fundamental to how AI operates. So how are you going out and claiming AI expertise when you don't know these fundamentals? so, you know, if someone's looking to kind of get. Use AI properly. I think getting someone who knows what they're doing and how it actually works to use it in context of where they are in business.\n\nAnd that's gonna make a huge difference just in general, [00:01:00] just straight away, rather than you having to find out what prompts are working and, it's definitely not about the prompts, it's more about the process or the process of how you get the result. That's why if you say, this is the framework, I'd like you to apply. You get a way better result 'cause it knows what you're trying to achieve. Things are gonna change and I don't want to put like this nice veil over things andsay that it's not, It's changing very quickly, and it's primarily because you can get the result faster, quicker, better. So why not use that? why not Like, really make that the focus I feel we get wrong is we allow AI to even disrupt our thinking of what focus looks like. And I'm asking everyone to not do that. I'm asking everyone, you already have your focus and Stick with your focus. Because as a leader, the only thing that you can potentially give everyone is focus.\n\nBetter than anything else, and give them that focus."

    "transcript": "142\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: [00:00:00] Today \n\nI'm gonna show you the most important skill. In growing a business, this is once you have your business set [00:00:10] up, the most important skill that you need to grow the business is to create standard operating procedures so that not only you can do it better, but others can do it better. And [00:00:20] today I'm gonna show you how to use artificial intelligence to do this at speed, to do this easier, to do this better.\n\n~And hopefully if my lights off s flickering, we can get this recording done.~ Come, let's learn.\n\nso in today's session, I have a plan for you. [00:00:30] I'm gonna talk about how I took a very, very complex task and made it into a standard operating procedure for the right people to follow or to exactly how I did [00:00:40] that. Actually, the example, I'm gonna start with that. So that's how you're gonna, I'm gonna start the session, then I'm gonna talk about how to structure your SOPs, where to keep them, how to store them, how to label them.[00:00:50] \n\nAnd~ what,~ what is the best way to keep them? I'm gonna talk about the different templates that you require and how you've gotta look at your standard operating procedures that are three different [00:01:00] types that you've gotta create inside when you're making a standard operating procedures. I'm gonna talk about how to reverse engineer them.\n\nI'm gonna talk about how to use the camcorder method. Shout out to [00:01:10] Dan Martel, that's from his book, buy Back Your Time. And then I'm gonna finally show you how to audit and upgrade your s SOPs if you already have them. Alright, so let's start [00:01:20] with the example. The first things first is right, just to give you background, ~obviously I've been obviously we,~\n\nso for the last 13 years we've been creating podcasts for some of the most famous people in the [00:01:30] world. And since the last three years we've been using AI to build systems and implementation and software. For various companies to [00:01:40] help them be more human in how they do business by using AI to do all the things that they don't really need to do.\n\nSo chiropractors are allowed to just chiropractic, [00:01:50] if that's a verb, and not worry about all the other admin stuff that comes around with it. How can we create and help coaches to just be good coaches? How did we help~ businesses?~ [00:02:00] Businesses to just deliver on the promises that they are making by using AI so that the humans can do better work.\n\nCould we create AI systems that allowed businesses [00:02:10] to implement a four day work week for their whole team, as an example? So we've been doing that for the last three years, and we are going all in on software development. [00:02:20] So we are at this position right now where we are creating, standard operating procedures.\n\nSo it is really important to show you how we're doing it [00:02:30] because it is very valuable for the hires that we're making and the results that we're getting as a result of kind of putting these together. So let's start Now, some of [00:02:40] the things in here might look a little a lot, but I wanna show you what happened.\n\n~The, the,~ what was happening was. We needed to create a local private server. [00:02:50] And for that to happen, ~we had, we've,~ we've obviously done it in the past, but we've not had a procedure to make sure it gets done. And it's a long procedure because it took a long time to set [00:03:00] up and make sure that everything was getting done and all the things were being set up.\n\nSo the goal is here ~on the,~ on the right hand side, you can see ~my screen~ is to have. A whole [00:03:10] bunch of containers up and running. Which store? NAN NGINX Porter Super Base, which is a, a, a database. ~And,~ and we need to be able to store this [00:03:20] on a local server. So this is created inside Prox Mox, which is a virtual environment.\n\nYou don't have to worry about the details, but what I'm trying to get at [00:03:30] is this is a particular complex task. And~ the,~ I'm gonna show you the procedure that I use to, you know, set up the SOPs. ~So this took about to set this all up, right?~ To [00:03:40] get this all up and running in this manner where ~I have my own.~\n\n~We have,~ as a team, we have our own access to nGenx. Locally we have our own access to NAN, which is free. We have our own [00:03:50] access to Porter, which shows ~you, shows~ all the. Containers and on the network and what is exactly in here. So we needed to be able to set this up in a way [00:04:00] that someone else didn't have to go through the process of doing this all over again.\n\nSo this took me about I'd say about a day and a half to set up ~in it,~ in its entirety. So I needed to make [00:04:10] it easier for someone else in our team who is gonna set up a virtual private server, whether it is locally or whether it is online. To make it easier for them to set it [00:04:20] up, to create it all. If they ran into any issues like I did, they would have ~the, the, the,~ the answer straight away.\n\nSo the ultimate goal was ~to,~ to have it like [00:04:30] this. ~So let me show you what that looked like.~ This is system 0 0 2, set up a virtual or local private server. And ~it, this is,~ this is all created by ai by the way. I'm gonna show [00:04:40] you how I did that. But it kind of created the whole thing for me, which is~ what, what, what,~ why do we need this framework?\n\nWho's responsible for it? When is this framework due? And how long [00:04:50] should it take? How we, you know, ~how,~ how long do we expect to complete it? And what are the main tasks involved? So ultimately the goal is that the is with all the [00:05:00] containers. Looks like this. This is what complete looks like. And then what is required for it to work and what's the framework?\n\nSo that's all put in. And then finally, it [00:05:10] kind of broke it down into phases. And each phase has steps, including exact instructions and installation commands to get it all working. [00:05:20] So this, like I said, complex and there would be a whole bunch of things that happened. So what I did was I went into. [00:05:30] Claude~ and let me show you what that looks like.~\n\n~So.~\n\n~Okay. ~So there are three things that I've attached to this prompt inside Claude. And by the way, I've tried this on a few different places. I've tried this on [00:05:40] Gemini.~ I didn't really get a really good what's here.~ The results have been drastic. I tried this on. Gemini, I tried this on perplexity. I tried this on chat,GPT and the best result I [00:05:50] got was in Claude.\n\nSo I'm just gonna show you the Claude version. Now I'm gonna read the prompt out and I'm gonna talk what, what each one of these sections are. Okay? So I got this [00:06:00] working, but I wanna create an SOP for someone else with no experience to complete. I've shared with you some notes I captured along the way and the final container view to see what is running.\n\nCan [00:06:10] you create a detailed SOP, be accurate, make it easy to understand and execute. I have also attached a history of my console logs so that you can see what I [00:06:20] did and in what order. Use the command logs as a rough guide to help you create a comprehensive SOP for someone to follow and execute. Look at my logs for things that might go wrong [00:06:30] and are corrected.\n\nAsk me anything to clarify your thinking and understanding, and think this through step by step and give me your reasoning. Now. That's the prompt. [00:06:40] I have attached to it my final container list. This is all the containers that what success or done looks like. ~Then I have~ so if you don't know inside [00:06:50] Linux, if you type history ~so this is on the left, on, on my left hand side is history.~\n\nIt shows you a whole history of all the commands that you've run. So I've took that history and~ I, I put, I, you know,~ exported it [00:07:00] out to a command log list or take t XT list. So I've attached that here. And also any notes that I've taken along the way you know, I've just kind of attached these and anything that came [00:07:10] along, including instructions from other places.\n\nI've just put it into a, a text file and I've kind of given it. And the great thing is that I've actually used Claude Opus four for [00:07:20] this, and I think that has made a huge difference because of how well. That model operates. So then what it does is it takes that and does an amazing job because what it says to [00:07:30] me is that from the logs, it identified several critical issues that I faced, which I totally did.\n\nLike it was not as simple and straightforward to just get it up and [00:07:40] running and set up, and that's why I, I really wanted to have an SOP ready. So if anyone, which people do this all the time, by the way, in a software development firm, this happens all the time and now. [00:07:50] That we are so heavy into developing software AI software for, for companies from the ground up.\n\nThese procedures are so, [00:08:00] so important. So, I ran into these issues. The Docker compose version was an issue that is something that was not in the doc. So how I went and did that~ the any,~ and there were [00:08:10] permission issues. So how to fix the file and the permission of those files. There was a missing super base and ENV file and how to copy from an example to [00:08:20] the right file, the Docker configuration using engine X and the multiple N eight N configuration attempts.\n\nBecause it kept, I kept struggling with getting it [00:08:30] to all of the same container all of the same network ~inside~ inside Docker. So then it took the whole thing through. Purpose, [00:08:40] prerequisites and the different phases along with all the commands to run, which is so like literally that is what has landed up ~in the,~ it did a phenomenal job [00:08:50] at not only taking my work, which is all the, you know, the sequence of, of commands because it was terminal and they were all commands that I typed, it made it easy [00:09:00] for me to like, copy and paste this and send it and say, Hey, this is actually what I did.\n\nCan you write the SOP from~ my,~ my commands and see ~what I,~ what I ran? So it did a [00:09:10] whole bunch of things and I did some ~really, a~ really good thing as well because in my system instructions, I ask for follow up questions. So it gives me follow up questions at the end of everything that it responses.\n\n[00:09:20] And then it said to me what specific~ it said,~ actually, it, it asked me, give me, you know, should I answer any of these five questions? And I said, actually. What I'd like you to do is gimme step-by-step [00:09:30] instructions for creating a backup and restoration ~proce or~ procedure, how to set up an SSL certificate, and how to create monitoring scripts.\n\nthen it went ahead [00:09:40] and created this guide, which is obviously the next step that we've gotta do on our~ on our~ local server to get [00:09:50] monitoring backups ~and, and, ~and SSL set up. So ~I,~ this is the process. The idea that I want to show you is how do you get this going? [00:10:00] So in your business, there will be ~co ~a couple of questions you might be having.\n\nYou'll be like, Hey, Ronley, how do I store this? And~ I'll show you. We,~ this is not the first time, obviously I'm creating this. If you didn't know ~my,~ I did ~a, a a~ [00:10:10] master of software engineering and, ~and my,~ my research thesis. Was on process quality, so auditing software processes ~and,~ and companies and taking [00:10:20] them to an ISO 9,001 or CMMI accreditation.\n\nSo this is the, Playbook for We are podcast, which is the other business ~that I,~ that I've been running. And it's basically the ~pro the~ [00:10:30] systems references and templates. That's what SRT stands for. ~It's a,~ you have to look ~them up. Look, look~ this up. ~I think it's a, actually, I'll look it up with you.~\n\n~SRT, Francis Francis. No, maybe it's not SRT framework I, I hope that works.~\n\n~Maybe I'll do.~\n\n~Templates.~\n\nSo I want to give credit to the person who came up with system references and templates because it [00:10:40] is from some great human being who's created that system, but I can't find the name. I'm so sorry. But it's quite simple to explain, but I just [00:10:50] really wanted to give credit. So systems are processes that, you know, get something done, like onboarding a new team member, editing an episode.\n\nIt's a old [00:11:00] system. All processes, references are something that don't change. These are the reference to something. So for example, here's a reference. Off the master list. Here's the reference of the [00:11:10] 10 biggest mistakes that people make when they start a business podcast. And templates are quite simple.\n\nWhat are the templates? So here's a template for a guest email invite. Here's a template [00:11:20] for a, should I start a podcast, live interview? Here's a template for a playbook. So ~there's all~ the systems, references and templates. This is the We are podcast one, but ~we've,~ we've had to create the new one [00:11:30] for Amplify ai.\n\nAnd again, they come into systems, references, and templates. It's like. What are the systems, what are the references and all the templates that the business needs to [00:11:40] run? So that's the way you organize your systems, references and templates and your SOPs. So that's how you set them up ~and,~ and I have created little templates in here.\n\nSo someone can [00:11:50] come in and create a new system and you reference a new template. Now you might be asking how, if I've already done it, what are the ways to sort of recreate it? [00:12:00] What are the ways to obviously retrace your steps? Now, in my case, I did not record the whole ~pro ~process. Like, you know, if I had Zoom running and~ if I,~ if I could [00:12:10] record ~whole ~all the steps, then maybe maybe that wouldn't have been easier because I would have been narrating it out loud, right?\n\nIt, I would've just, it would just be capturing the [00:12:20] screen. But there would be no way for the AI to know exactly what was happening because. The AI is not looking at the video, right? The AI's looking at a transcription and [00:12:30] taking the transcription and then processing it. So, for me, in my case, I used the history and I said, okay, look at the history and see what I came up against.\n\n~And, and, and,~ and this [00:12:40] is what I was trying to do, these all my notes. This is the history. This is what success looks like. Create me, the SOP but also in my project files, I have a template for what a good [00:12:50] SOP looks like. So if I were you, I would do things like go into perplexity, ~perplexity. ~I've got a pro account~ and let me show you what that looks like.~\n\n~This is perplexity here, and~ so perplexity allows you to go and research a lot of [00:13:00] things ~and,~ and so does chat, GPT. So ~I,~ I would use those two places. Would search switched on or agent switched on, or deep research switched on ~in, in,~ in chat GPT and [00:13:10] inside complexity. I would sort of come into the research.\n\nAnything tab hit that. And I'm showing you an example of other templates here. So, so [00:13:20] research for me product requirements, definitions, ~it's a p,~ it's a PRD is a~ is a, a~ term for ~pro.~ Project requirements.~ It is, it is something that,~\n\n~let me start that project requirements again.~\n\n~Okay,~ so here's an example of me doing some [00:13:30] research using perplexity. On PRD templates. Now, PRD are ~product requirements~ product requirement document, and it is a standard document that's required in general [00:13:40] before you start a software development project. And so what I'm doing here is I'm saying, Hey, research for me PRD templates that I've worked and that others have [00:13:50] used, find at least 10 templates that have that templates.\n\nAnd then based on what you find, create me a template that is best of all worlds. For an Agile software development project, [00:14:00] be accurate and precise. So it went ahead and did you know, some research. Obviously if you can look here on the side, you'll notice all ~the, the,~ the links to [00:14:10] what it's looking at.\n\nSo it's done a, great job. And then it's broken down the sections as to what was ~most~ in most of the rds. Right. And then ultimately it came up with this. [00:14:20] Which is the ultimate PRD, it has got executive summary, problem definition, open questions and then it also said this, so I got this as an example, ~and then let me show you ultimately what it looked like. So now.~\n\n~Oh, that's not the one.~\n\n~Fuck, I don't know where it is. Anyway leave it. Let me just talk to her straight away.~\n\nSo [00:14:30] I got this structure from Perplexity, right? It gave me this detailed outline of what the standard sections in A-P-R-D-R that I took that, and I put that [00:14:40] into chat. GPTI had a conversation and said, Hey, this is what we've created before. Have a look at these examples of previous. \n\nCompanies \n\nthat we've done [00:14:50] PRDs for this is, ~this is~ our style and structure.\n\nHere is a new style and structure. I want to make sure that we are not missing anything. I've compared them both. And I [00:15:00] finally got an output. And then that output is what went into this, which is ~the,~\n\n~which is.~\n\n~Which is~ this template here. So it'll break it down into [00:15:10] executive summary, context, problem, user personas, goals, outcomes, and this whole detailed requirements with functions and user experience and so on. But not only can is it [00:15:20] broken down into a template. Under each one of this, it actually outlines how to fill it out.\n\n~So. It,~ this template has the what as well as the how. [00:15:30] So I could easily download this, this document, this template, and go into AI and say, Hey, here's a new ~doc, a new~ client that we have. Here's ~the,~ [00:15:40] the requirements, or this is what they want. Can you create a detailed ~project requirements,~ product requirements document based on this?\n\n~And here's, here's,~ so it'll go through the template and easily fill it out, which becomes so much [00:15:50] easier. To do so, those are templates. Now, there are different ways, and I highly recommend using Dan Martel's method of the camcorder method, which is do it for the [00:16:00] last time and record it. Record your screen and talk through it.\n\nAnd now we've done a few of those. And let me show you what that looks like.\n\nSo using the [00:16:10] camcorder method and loom, ~you are,~ you are very well placed to create some beautiful SOPs, for example. ~This is~ these are some of the videos that obviously I've created. Some, ~some ~are watched, some are [00:16:20] not. so here's a whole video is an example. Now we we're hiring ~a, a,~ a new admin assistant, or executive assistant for me, and I recorded a [00:16:30] couple of videos a while ago on how to process my email. So I went through and I processed the email myself, and then I recorded [00:16:40] it. But ~inside the good thing about Loom is, ~The great thing about Loom is on the right hand side, if you have a loom for ai which you know, the normal account, I think this is a $10 a month [00:16:50] account, if I'm right. You can just come in here and click create SOP or generate a document. And that's really useful because it's a very, very good tool and could easily do that.\n\n[00:17:00] So I highly recommend the camcorder method. Obviously if you have things like what we've been doing here with the history, it's easier to show your work and then use that as an example. But~ the,~ the goal [00:17:10] here. Is for you to create systems, references and templates, SOPs for your company, for your business, so that others can do the work.\n\nBut not only that, this is really [00:17:20] useful because it doesn't have to be as detailed as I showed you. It can be as simple as a checklist. It can be, this is how I set up a landing page and do this, do [00:17:30] that, do this, do that. It's literally a checklist of things. And every time you set up a landing page, it's gonna be so much easier for you to follow that because you're not having to think of the process [00:17:40] and do the thing at the same time.\n\nHaving any process written down, I promise you, is gonna make the world of difference. You might think that it's hard just because you're not used [00:17:50] to it, but I promise you it's the number one thing you need to grow your business. This is how to use AI to ride your SOPs and do it at speed and get it done [00:18:00] the right way.\n\nThis is Ronsley and I hope you join me for the next episode of Amplify ai. Until then, I hope you use AI to make your business more human. Much love. \n\n[00:18:10] love. ~I.~"

    "transcript": "143\n===\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~No.~\n\n~Hmm. Testing. ~\n\n~Testing.~\n\n~All right,~\n\n~All right. ~\n\n~we are recording ~\n\n~We are recording~\n\n~Presu Asian. ~\n\n~Presu Asian. ~\n\n~So there's this brilliant idea in that, I'll start again. ~\n\n~that. I'll start there's this brilliant idea that good marketing makes sales easy. ~\n\n~makes sales ~\n\n~is the idea of Presion. I mean, I wrote that down on a card. I'll talk to you all about it. And in presion or Presion, we meet our audiences where they're at and we create assets for them that compound over time.~\n\n~Today I'm gonna show you how to do that at speed. So if you were in a similar position as me and wanted to create like useful videos for your audiences, that was termed as good marketing, I'll ask you to give you. I'll ask you to give me 15 minutes of your time, and in that time I will show you how to use AI at speed, but also to create authentic, really good marketing that is useful for your audience, but also gets them closer to yes, whatever that looks like for you.~\n\n~Your, the idea in this session is I'm gonna show you everything that I've done and I'm gonna show you how to get it done yourself. Come, let's learn. ~\n\n~Come, let's learn.~\n\n~All right. ~\n\n~It's the start. Obviously. Just cut that out a little bit when I mean, you guys know what you're doing.~\n\n~I mean, you guys know what you do. ~\n\n~what you're doing. ~\n\n~Okay, so backstory ~\n\n~backstory~\n\n~backstory.~ [00:00:00] A month ago I was in Mexico at an event. Great event. And in that event I took down this \n\nI took down this. \n\npiece of note, [00:00:10] which is Rethink your Content Recording Strategy. And on the back of that I made a little note which read. [00:00:20] Presion Marketing makes sales easy, and it's this idea that I got from this event in Los Cabo and because I wrote it down [00:00:30] like I have other \n\n~I get to action them or~ I put them on the back burner.\n\nAnd because this was a very important action. Here it is, and today I'm gonna show you how to go from idea to [00:00:40] context to make useful pre to Asian marketing. This is kind of on the intersection of creating assets, which I learned from Daniel Priestly. Huge shout out to him. [00:00:50] Create assets for your business that compound over time.\n\nSo it is bringing assets together with dog fooding. It's another great concept if you haven't. If you don't know what that [00:01:00] is, I, I suggest searching it. It's the idea of eating your own dog food. So this, these next actually, uh, I'm going on this really interesting [00:01:10] journey and this is the first of many episodes where uh, I bring together AI and podcasting.\n\nI bring together creation of assets and dog fooding. [00:01:20] And you know what? I've heard this a lot and I think today is, now is a really good time Uh, AI is made up fields and everyone's trivializing it. People are just learning themselves. They're just [00:01:30] saying things in good marketing and everyone's believing it because they see a video.\n\nBut I kind of want show you something. Just gimme a sec. \n\nyou something. ~Just gimme a second. ~\n\n~This, this is the Bible, by the way. This is the Bible of artificial~ intelligence, everything, all the basics [00:01:40] here. And I want, I, I just wanna tell um, come together to create artificial intelligence? All right, the first one,\n\nAll right, \n\nthe first one, [00:01:50] \n\npH.\n\nCan formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions? How does the mind arise from a physical brain? Where does knowledge come from? All this is part of philosophy doesn't field number one. Number two, [00:02:00] field number two is mathematics. What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions? What can be computed?\n\nComputed? How do we reason with uncertain information? [00:02:10] Number three, economics. How should we make decisions in accordance with our preferences? How should we do this when others may not go along the next field after [00:02:20] economics is neuroscience. How do brain process information?\n\nCamera B: brains process information? \n\nRonsley Vaz: psychology. How do humans and animals think and act? So [00:02:30] in that, there's cognitive psychology. There's a whole bunch of different ones. Number six is. Computer engineering, how can we build an efficient computer? Number seven [00:02:40] is control theory and cybernetics. How can artifacts operate under their own control?\n\nAnd number eight is linguistics. How does language relate [00:02:50] to thought? Now I'm just, I'm literally just, you know, brushing the surface just explaining what Different, very valid fields that have come together to [00:03:00] create artificial intelligence. And it is kind of being trivialized on top of the computer engineering field is each, there's memory and long term memory and short term memory.\n\nThere's so many aspects that come together. [00:03:10] And today's session, I'm gonna show you how to ideate, how to create, how do you start your journey if you're like me, on how to make videos or create [00:03:20] topics, or actually just create assets in general. Alright, so let's start with. The idea of persuasion and the Amplify AI persuasion [00:03:30] framework.\n\npersuasion framework. Asian framework. Now, this is really important to understand as the basis for all the episodes going forward. [00:03:40] When you think about your audience, right, they are in a couple of places, but they are either audience. or active in their buying intent.\n\nAnd you can, [00:03:50] and we've represented that by the X axis here. So the either latent. Or they're active. And the Y axis is they're either low on trust and proof that you can deliver, [00:04:00] or they're high on the trust and proof that that, that you the, in terms of marketing, that's all you have to worry about in terms of presion.\n\nYou just [00:04:10] have to worry about these four elements. The, or intent. And the trust and proof. And now you might think that this is not an important [00:04:20] po piece in the puzzle, and you only have to focus on orchestrating the yes. And it's not true. Each one of these sections here are very important and you gotta [00:04:30] create assets that get them to this point of where they say yes to buying.\n\nOkay, let's start with. If they are [00:04:40] low on trust and proof, they don't know who you are, they don't know what you, what, what you can deliver. They're very new audience to you and they're kind of latent in their buying. You know, they're not, they're not [00:04:50] ready yet. So in that, in that instance, they and patent.\n\nThey, your, your job is to earn attention via rep reciprocity. You want to [00:05:00] earn attention via reciprocity, and in this space you want to create. A bunch of different assets. Something that delivers quick wins, something that's less than three [00:05:10] minutes. A video that actually delivers some value in way they think, in the way they act, in how they're gonna do things going forward.\n\nOkay? Uh, return on [00:05:20] something. Really important. Swipe a pool checklist. So in your, in this of assets, and I'm gonna show you. Over the next few episodes and in the episodes coming up, [00:05:30] how to do these at speed \n\nCamera B: to do these at \n\nRonsley Vaz: using make them true to you.\n\nJust like how today's episode is and how, you know, what you're seeing [00:05:40] right now is created using ai. But it's all built on a lot of knowledge and, and, and work as a company. Okay. [00:05:50] And in KPIs. Like, what are the opt-in rates? What's the time on page?\n\nWhat are the new accounts that start following? So this is like really important KPIs to keep track of. [00:06:00] And if I were you, I would start thinking about AI team members that augment \n\nCamera B: that augments \n\nRonsley Vaz: what your human team members do to, to [00:06:10] allow them to So this, these are.\n\nAI team that could help you in this prime and pattern stage, which are like uh, signal listeners. They're listening [00:06:20] signals in the you of things that you don't have to go out and search for. You can create personalized leads, magnets, and to create strategy and pillar content [00:06:30] like we're doing today.\n\nSo that's all in the prime section. Okay, so. If we move along and they are, you know, have, have active [00:06:40] buying intent, of low on the trust cycle. Now these people are ready to buy. However, they, \n\nCamera B: however, \n\nRonsley Vaz: um, whether you can actually deliver on what you're [00:06:50] saying you can.\n\nOkay. And if that's the case, then you want to. You wanna borrow state, and neutralize risk with the proof, with proof that can that's our [00:07:00] goal in this section. So to create assets there, we want to create like a a a 92nd clip. We wanna show outcome [00:07:10] snapshots.\n\nWe want to create content that is before and after dashboards that have worked. We want to have uh, \n\nCamera B: We want to have, \n\nRonsley Vaz: real words and case [00:07:20] studies and people saying good things about us. And that's kind of borrowed, borrowed authority in this area, looking \n\nCamera B: this area you're looking for, \n\nRonsley Vaz: know, back to you, how much are they consuming [00:07:30] and how many of them are asking for demos or does this work?\n\nI want to help can you help? Can you help me AI team members that can help your. Human team members do their That's [00:07:40] a case study assembler. You know, an AI can totally, you know, do that. An auto nurturer, which is an AI that will nurture a lead automatically and personalize it, [00:07:50] a retargeting ai.\n\nSo really interesting ways of now doing \n\nCamera B: ways of \n\nRonsley Vaz: marketing or using AI that [00:08:00] potentially you are missing out on because maybe you haven't thought about it like myself, but. And we've got some of these in play. I'm gonna show you over the next obviously few episodes how we build them as [00:08:10] well. So again, now for, for people the trust value, for example, now they know that you can deliver.\n\nThey, they, they know [00:08:20] that you are, \n\nCamera B: know that you \n\nRonsley Vaz: they're not ready to buy yet. They're in the, in that latent buying intent space. So basically what you want is just to keep, make sure that you are continuing to [00:08:30] add value. Uh, This video potentially could be uh, one of those where I'm just adding value.\n\nBut, you know, it is no, there's no [00:08:40] to buy. It's, Hey, have you thought of these things in your business? And what you're doing here, you're trying to make sure that they, they, these assets compound over time and [00:08:50] they keep. You top of mind right in here.\n\nYou have like serial mini lessons. You can invite, I could invite people to office hours. I can give them [00:09:00] ROI calculators that we've built for our clients and maybe have um, acquired a, to our clients license and we could just give them that. So they already [00:09:10] are know, but you know, that we can deliver.\n\nBut you know, they, they're not ready to buy yet. And that's totally cool. In that space, you should have an an AI team member that. [00:09:20] Distilled topics an idea and it'll give you a topic an AI team and distribute it through your pipeline of different places that you are active or your audience is [00:09:30] active and they know that you can deliver or they, they're paying attention to you on those platforms.\n\nAnd finally, this is what everyone sort of does. And [00:09:40] sometimes if the. If your person in this area, but you give them this kind of asset to orchestrate the yes, then it's a big jump for them. And you [00:09:50] feel like they feel like you're being salesy though you're not. And we want to avoid that, right? So when people are in this area and they have high proof, they know that you can deliver [00:10:00] and their buying intent is there.\n\nYou want. \n\nCamera B: there. \n\nRonsley Vaz: To orchestrate the yes, you want to make sure that acting now is just the [00:10:10] obvious step. And if that's the case, you have to create some assets, like, you know, what is the fast start bonus that you can offer them? What are the implementation windows that exist [00:10:20] that allow you as a company to deliver the best result for your people?\n\nLike for example, we only take, you know, a certain amount of clients in every month and we are very [00:10:30] clear that we can't take. A client on at any time, at every time, because we've gotta get ready as a team to take on the workload. We've gotta make sure that we've onboarded [00:10:40] the client correctly. And also you cohorts and in these limited cohort invites and these assets that you're making, which by the way, I'm gonna show you exactly how to do it.\n\nI want to [00:10:50] show you how we are gonna do ours. So you can do yours, just like how I'm gonna show you uh, in, a little bit how I built this framework using ai [00:11:00] um, which is come up, right? Um, In this section KPIs to track, which is conversion rates, you know, time to close and deal velocity in the sense that how [00:11:10] much leads are coming in and how those deals are being processed.\n\nCamera B: Processed, \n\nRonsley Vaz: about that's really gonna help is like a triage [00:11:20] AI team member for sure. One that qualifies and routes them into a certain area, a personalized offer, AI that can deliver an offer [00:11:30] based on a sales call. And like daily rollups that, you know, if you're getting a lot of traffic coming in, an AI team member that makes sure that it.\n\nTakes all [00:11:40] that data and summarizes it and gives it to the right person in the right time, in the right order. So this is a, you know, like going forward, I'm gonna show you how to create all these [00:11:50] different assets, you know, for all these different sections of your audience. Today is obviously an overview of this uh, framework, but I'm gonna show you my [00:12:00] screen in a second \n\nCamera B: how. \n\nRonsley Vaz: And actually it's really, really useful. \n\nCamera B: Useful. \n\nRonsley Vaz: So started. Very simply, I, note that that note, [00:12:10] which I thought was uh, the idea. So for me to. To, for, for the some research. So I went into perplexity. And Perplexity a, a, a really [00:12:20] cool tool.\n\nhappen to have a pro account, but you can use this even on the, free account allows you to do a bunch of different, [00:12:30] three different pro users a day. So you can use one of them for this. So. Literally I video about Presu agent and how marketing makes sales easy.\n\nAmplify [00:12:40] ais.com is our website. We build a i team members for businesses, a million in revenue and above. There will be a way to strategize, ideate, create, repurpose, publish, market this, [00:12:50] consider it a type of dog fooding see what works right now and what is key for my audience. So I wanted to kind of go out and do some research and come back and then what [00:13:00] it did strategy.\n\nPresu agent for, for Amplify AI is the core concept issu agent. As a sales accelerator, your video should position Presu agent as a bridge between marketing [00:13:10] and effortless sales. And it kind of had of the three, three psychological triggers to highlight is reciprocity, social proof, and authority, and scarcity and [00:13:20] urgency.\n\nUm. So what go too far down this, I didn't like, I read the whole thing, which was structure core content, a framework. But [00:13:30] you know, I, I saw this, the Presion framework and I said, oh, that is a great idea, idea in terms of this is a really good way to [00:13:40] anchor. This video to the rest of the videos that I'm gonna create because I wanted to create persuasion and I want to create a stop.\n\nSo I wanted to create a [00:13:50] persuasion framework. Now I took that and I into\n\nWe have don't know who. Uh, if you don't [00:14:00] know who Edith is Edith is our ai uh, that is an amplify AI and ethics driven uh, [00:14:10] intelligence. triage helper. That's the full form of Edith. inside the way, in, in, in one of the upcoming, the next we built Edith so you can [00:14:20] build. And need it for your business. But I took that and I said either I need help to create a persuasion framework for marketing using a i. [00:14:30] So you notice that I've not even spelled that correctly. to explain this or another framework that you think is better.\n\nHere's some context. And I literally copied and pasted the first [00:14:40] section,\n\ngave out, right? Until the right position, central question. So I said design the Presu agent framework. Now it [00:14:50] thought for a while, 28 seconds to be exact, and it came up with this, here's a clean found, a friendly way to make persuasion, which is the two by [00:15:00] two power grid.\n\nNow I'll, you know, just uh, another framework, which is the presion flywheel. It's an operating loop where you listen, learn, and we've [00:15:10] built these ais we've named.\n\nJust like how we have Edith, we have radar that listens and tracks intense signals. We have scout that learns and enriches the [00:15:20] account and kind of adds to. A knowledge base. So we have all these different ones. That's what you're seeing here in, in um, that is from base, but it's, it's [00:15:30] kind of gone and another really cool um, a also done this great job of doing, you know, the, the, the message what to [00:15:40] say, triggers and all this kind of stuff. Yeah, but while it gave me this, I thought what was really important for me is to understand what it [00:15:50] put out. So then I took this AI appreciation power grid, which was exactly what I was after, which I just presented to you earlier.\n\nRight? And it [00:16:00] really broke it down. Now, I didn't write everything down because, for example. Um, You wouldn't was until I kind of mentioned these right now. So it's pulling this [00:16:10] from E'S knowledge base. Um, really great breakdown of a framework, was very valuable and that's really how I created that [00:16:20] today.\n\nWhich sometimes when you look at something like that, you would think that, and there used to be a time where I would have to like think for a long time to [00:16:30] come up with each one of these sections. Now, not only has it given me this amazing framework, but it's told me. All these really important [00:16:40] assets that I need to create, which we have some of them, but we don't have them in a really proper way that we can make u useful.\n\nSo it's these [00:16:50] areas, which is the dog fooding piece of us creating, or me creating this for our business as part of our recording process. [00:17:00] So join me in the upcoming videos. I'm gonna show you how we're gonna create a bunch of assets. In the next one, I'll we created Edith, how we created a, a structure and a [00:17:10] framework to create these videos.\n\nAnd if you want anything that I've just shared, you know, put it in the comments or wherever you found this. So, um, one of the team will find what you're [00:17:20] after. Uh, I would love to be able These things are really important because commoditizing AI and it's used. In the right way and not [00:17:30] people just making up new words and just for marketing and making everyone think that, that that's the way to do it.\n\nSo I want to [00:17:40] remove the hassle of bad information \n\nCamera B: of bad \n\nRonsley Vaz: and, and hopefully give you something that, that you can use now. \n\nCamera B: that's \n\nRonsley Vaz: 24 [00:17:50] minutes. \n\nCamera B: Thanks team. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~ If you know a business or a friend or a founder that has built their business and needs a i team members, share this episode with them, or another one that you enjoyed.

You know, it's one of those things I think, you know, a, a lot of people when they come out with a book, they're really focused on like trying to hit bestseller lists and all that kind of stuff, and that, for me is not a serious component of this launch at all.~\n\n~If it happens, great, I'll celebrate it, but the important part for me. Is that the book gets into as many hands that need to read it right now in their journey. That's the bigger play for me as the author of this book. Particularly it's a very personal book as well. Like I really open up the kimono pretty wide in this book.~\n\n~I tell very, very personal stories and those who have read it early and have gotten back to me. The comments. I got a comment from my buddy who I know, you know, Hal Lro. He text me just literally two days ago. I was hanging out with him in Nashville a few weeks ago at an author retreat. And I gave him a copy and he read it on the plane home and he text me just a couple of days ago and he said to me, man, this has been the biggest kick in the face I have had in years.~\n\n~So, you know, to ha to have. Smart, successful people like that to read the book and say, man, I really needed this right now. This is, this is good stuff. That for me is better than any kind of best seller ranking or anything like that. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I, I, I totally agree. And, and ~~when someone, you, someone you respect really well or really highly comes up to you and said, I've read the book, that is, you know, that is for me, even as I, I'd feel I.~\n\n~Feel very, very lucky and blessed. And I feel the whole journey of getting to the book and putting the effort into the book and writing the book and editing the book, and that whole birth feels justified after that. But you talk about this, you know, season not a lifestyle idea. You obviously, you talked about how you open up in the book and, you know, chronic adrenal fatigue and I mean, I've known you for a while, I've known.~\n\n~A long time. What made you write? What, what,~ [00:00:00] ~ what was the point where you went, I have to write this book? ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~it was so 2021 I burnt out pretty hard, like you said, adrenal fatigue. I was actually diagnosed with depression. I was put on antidepressants for a year as well, a little over a year.~\n\n~Anxiety was another issue that I was dealing with at the time. And the really weird thing is that from a business perspective. We were crushing it, I mean, 2021, we were in the middle of the pandemic. A lot of what we were doing in person as an education company had obviously pivoted online. And therefore opened up this huge potential client base that we wouldn't have normally have had for these particular coaching programs and and courses and things like that.~\n\n~And so our revenue skyrocketed~~. I mean, we had an amazing, amazing year in 2021 and the work I was doing. Was really enjoyable to me. Like ~~I love working with other entrepreneurs. I love working with other leaders. It's what fires me up. It's what gets me outta bed in the morning, quite literally, right? So it's not like I wasn't enjoying the work, it was just too much plain and simple.~\n\n~I was overdoing it. And when I hit that burnout and I got those diagnosis~~ I was just like, you know what? I gotta really take a look. How I'm living my life here. Not just the work stuff, but like everything, health, fitness, lifestyle, family you know, going on proper breaks, you know, all that kind of stuff.~\n\n~And that's when I started making all the notes. And I'm, I'm a, like, I'm obsessive. Like I, when I go into something, I go all in on something. And this is all I thought about for like a month~~. Literally. I was read, I was reading clinical studies. On the benefits of hydrogen water consumption in regards to helping our cells to recover and, and reset and all the rest of it, right?~\n\n~And yes, I drink hydrogen water every single day now as a result of that. But it, it was, ~~it was one of those situations I was like, okay, now I'm gonna talk to some of my friends~~ and, and, and my peers and see what the deal is with them. ~~And I started checking in on people. And a lot of people were feeling.~\n\n~Exactly the same way. They were feeling tired, they were feeling stressed, they were feeling overwhelmed. They were feeling anxious. So I thought, well,~~ if I'm not the only one dealing with this, there must be others out there~~. And I started looking further afield, more research, more conversations, et cetera, et cetera.~\n\n~And that's really what brought about the book.~~ ~~So I want to clarify like my other two books have come about before this third one have come about because of nothing but my own experience,~~ virtual Freedom 2014 I was in the outsourcing and, and VA game for. Eight years when I wrote that book, rise of the Eur 2018 is all about building a business around your expertise and your personal brand.~\n\n~Well, I've been doing that for over a decade at that point, ~~and with the long haul leader, this is something that I've been living for the last seven, eight years and recovering from for the last four or five years.~~ ~~And so, just another place of experience, it's personal stories, it's personal takeaways, and the overall message of the fact that, burnout is not a badge of honor. It's a warning sign that you're doing things wrong~~. We have, ~~and as a society, particularly as an entrepreneurial society, I believe we've, we've glorified exhaustion to the point of it being now almost epidemic status~~. And you know, it, it, ~~it's not about how hard you can go, it's about how long you're gonna last~~, and that's the overall message of the ~book.\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I mean is~ this is a really interesting conversation for a variety of different reasons. I mean, I've had lots of conversations with lots of entrepreneurs, especially around the psychology ~of the think and how we do certain things and how we do certain things.~ I [00:00:10] feel like in general, I can't tell when I'm tired~ until I'm, or.~\n\nIs there a way that you've figured out ~to,~ to tell when you're hitting that [00:00:20] point or if you're hitting that point? ~Or is there some way to kind of know what too, because again, if I compare growing up in India, going to Australia and then going to the US and going to other places, the definition of what is hard work is very different in all different parts.~\n\n~Yeah. You know. So, have you figured out what it is for for us at what point? Because I can go, I can keep going. I can't anymore. ~\n\nChris Ducker: This is the thing. A, a lot of the time, almost all of the time, unfortunately, you realize you're burned out. [00:00:30] When you're burned out and it's not the initial stage of burnout that you figure it out because you do power through, you do keep going, and therefore you [00:00:40] get deeper into burnout before you actually discovered, oh my God, like I need to take a break right now.\n\nLike this is. Awful. I feel terrible. And with my burnout, you know, [00:00:50] we, we actually, in 2021, every August we take a one month sabbatical as a family. And I remember going into that sabbatical that year [00:01:00] feeling really, really tired. Now, it was, because again, I wanna clarify, it wasn't that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing.\n\nI was, it was just, I was doing way, way, way [00:01:10] too much of it. And so I remember going into that sabbatical, thinking to myself, man, I really need this break. Like I really need it this year. And when I came back, [00:01:20] I walked into this office, I sat down at this computer. ~This is a whole, you know, first week of September I turn on my computer.~\n\nI stared at the screen for 20 minutes. There are abouts. I turned off the computer, [00:01:30] worked back out the the doors behind me here, and I didn't walk back in for another three weeks. I wasn't ready to get back to work. I was still tired, so even an entire month off didn't give [00:01:40] me what I needed in regards to the chance to recharge and recalibrate from a physical and a mental perspective as well.\n\nAnd that was what brought about the [00:01:50] diagnoses because I would go to the doctor and say, this is where I am. I'm not feeling good. By 11:00 AM I'm done. Like, no amount of coffee is gonna get me through it, et cetera, [00:02:00] et cetera, kind of thing. So generally, the warning signs of burnout usually come into three major categories.\n\nNumber one, it's overall fatigue. [00:02:10] You feel tired. the single cup of coffee that you might have in the morning ain't enough. You need two or three to get through the day, right? ~That sort of thing.~ So just the general physical [00:02:20] feeling of being tired and exhausted. The second thing is mentally, mentally things like brain.\n\nCreep up. You can't remember [00:02:30] simple things that you would usually be able to recall very, very quickly. So that comes into play as well. And then lastly is the emotional side of burnout. A lot of people don't think about this or even [00:02:40] discuss it, quite frankly. ~And, and the big reason why is because I think it's, it's one of those things that's a little rah rah.~\n\n~Oh, I'm so, I'm so emotionally drained. I'm so emotionally tired. Well,~ it's a real thing. And we should talk about it. And us men, we're idiots. We have genuine issues talking about our emotions in general.~ In general, right. So it's, it's,~ it's one of those things where it's [00:02:50] like emotionally, if you don't feel up to a task, ~particularly,~ particularly a task that you feel like you should be called to do, to serve, if you don't feel up to that task.[00:03:00] \n\nThere's a problem there as well. And they're the three big warning signs. Right. And like you say, unfortunately most of us power through them and then we just get deeper and deeper into the whole. And then it becomes [00:03:10] harder to get out. Obviously, \n\nRonsley Vaz: you know, that's such a, such a great conversation for so many different reasons because.\n\nYou know, for me, [00:03:20] I don't know any other different way in terms of if things are not going according to the way I want it to go, the only way I know to do anything is to work harder at [00:03:30] something or, yeah. Like double the reps or, you know, and, and I'm not saying that~ I've, I,~ I think I've gotten better. Through the years as an entrepreneur.\n\nAnd I think that's only [00:03:40] because, to your point of hobbies, I feel like initially it was just, ~just ~get out of this hole that you are in and use the [00:03:50] business and only focus on, ~on ~revenue, and then you to a point where you realize, wait, all this is just if I'm not around and if I'm not around. Like [00:04:00] to your point ~on, on,~ on mentally, physically, emotionally if I'm not around in those three domains, I'm kind of useless and I'm making this whole thing a lot worse than it is.\n\nYeah. [00:04:10] So I'd love for you to talk about the hobby piece because it comes to the long haul. Maybe do the Yo-yo diet thing on our entrepreneur life [00:04:20] as well. You know, maybe ~the,~ to actually have homeostasis as they call it. \n\nChris Ducker: The thing is, even when we do take time off, we feel guilty about the time that we're [00:04:30] spending away from building our business.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is you shouldn't feel guilty. You actually feel pretty bloody proud. and, Good about the fact that you're taking time for yourself because [00:04:40] self-care is not selfish. It's actually the number one strategy for every leader, every entrepreneur that wants to do incredibly well in what it is that they're doing [00:04:50] business-wise without self-care.\n\nLike you said, we're kind of no good to anybody, and that's why hobbies and pastimes are one of the most important parts of that four step long-haul leader [00:05:00] life os or operating system that we talk about in the book. I'll break it down very quickly,~ so. Four major. Actually, I should say.~ I should say there was only three major components of this framework when I started writing the book.[00:05:10] \n\nThere was the personal mastery side of things, so working on yourself, your health, your mental health, your learning ability, all that kind of stuff. That was number one. Number two was love and [00:05:20] relationships because. I feel that as an entrepreneur, as a leader, particularly, unless you've got the support network and the right type of relationships away from work, as well as at work, [00:05:30] obviously you're not gonna be able to achieve all that much.\n\nRight? So that was always gonna be included. And then thirdly, there was the impactful work that we do, the clients we work with, the people we [00:05:40] serve, the work that we're known for. When we're not around, what do people say about us? You know, how do they talk about us in terms of the impact that we're having with them?\n\nRight? And so that was the. [00:05:50] Framework. There was three parts. That was it. But then when I went deeper and I started researching and I started looking and talking to other people in terms of what they were doing for longevity [00:06:00] in business and life, the hobbies in the pastime started to pop up over and over and over and over again.\n\nAnd when I looked at things from my own perspective. [00:06:10] As well, particularly post burnout 22, 23 and some of 24. ~This book was finished a good year and a bit ago. You know, it was interesting because. ~I realized actually my hobbies play a major part in my [00:06:20] recovery away from work.~ If I'm not out, you know, doing wildlife photography, which is one of my hobbies, or bonsai, which is another, or painting, I'm a watercolor artist as well in my spare time.~\n\nSo if I'm not doing those things, then what am I doing to switch off? And if I'm not switching off, how's that gonna help me or [00:06:30] not help me at work? And so hobbies became an actual, very integral part of the book and the importance of that. And one of the pieces of research that we [00:06:40] discovered, and this was from a Forbes survey, I believe from a good few years ago.\n\nLeaders, ~C-suite executives C-E-O-C-F-O-C-O-O, entrepreneurial leaders, small business owners, even solopreneurs were part of this survey as well,~ that if they spend a minimum of two [00:06:50] hours a week engaging in these personal pastimes or hobbies that they had the ability to boost their productivity in their work [00:07:00] life by as much as 30%.\n\nWhen someone says, oh man, I wish I could just get more done, or I wish I could do more in less time. You know, [00:07:10] my answer now is gonna be, go find a hobby. Plain and simple. And actually one of, ~one of~ the biggest names ~in financial~ in the financial world is a guy under the name of David Solomon. [00:07:20] Now David Solomon is the CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest companies on the planet, and his hobby is DJing, believe it or not, dance.[00:07:30] \n\nStance DJing. He is known as Dj D. Soul actually in as his alter ego. And this guy, I mean, he donates all the money he makes from his DJ gigs and he [00:07:40] gets booked, trust me. And he donates everything to charity. 'cause he need the money, obviously. But the fact that you've got this guy who's running ~the,~ one of the biggest financial institutions on the planet, [00:07:50] he has a hobby.\n\nWhy can't you? Why can't I? Why can't other people? We should be looking at this as a genuine. Genuine focus for our life. It's [00:08:00] very, very important. As leaders, \n\nRonsley Vaz: This is obviously very important as not only for longevity, but just as how we lead others. Because the [00:08:10] tendency, if we feel guilty by stepping away, maybe we have under issues with having team that step away and there's a whole bunch of issues that sort of [00:08:20] it's a snowball effect.\n\nI'm obviously gonna ask you about AI because when you talk about zone of genius and zone of being competent, right? ~Like, do you,~ how do you see AI playing a role in there? [00:08:30] Because it, it feels like competency is being taken care of by ai. So we can actually spend a lot more time in our zone of genius or even start to do [00:08:40] things from a hobby perspective, like for example.\n\nI've always wanted to have my own servers set up where I was, and it was always [00:08:50] hard because I~ I would run,~ there would be something small that stopped me and ~it would be,~ it would take me a few days to figure out, and when I had, maybe I, it took another few days and it just stopped [00:09:00] momentum. But now with ai, every time I hit a roadblock, I can, you know, get out of it.\n\nI've been in so Many things as a result. where do you see things changing? 'cause a lot of things have [00:09:10] changed since you've become an entrepreneur since you've written the first, second and now the third book. How does AI play a role in this? \n\nChris Ducker: I think AI plays an important role. I, I'll be the first to admit [00:09:20] as well that when.\n\nThe AI conversation started a couple of years ago. I kind of avoided it. I, I, you know, it's like anything else. I don't [00:09:30] know anything about it. Therefore, I'm, I'm not in a position to talk about it. I remember when NFTs became all the rage and everybody was investing in these digital [00:09:40] images and things.\n\nI thought it was like, this is. Bonkers. This is absolute madness. Like I can understand buying a Rembrandt or something, but [00:09:50] just some digital image from some dude that's made it on the internet. No, this, this makes no sense to me. So I just stayed quiet. Right. And so with ai, I was a late adopter [00:10:00] to this and you actually played a big part of this in all of this, as you know, 'cause you came over to England.\n\nYou know, earlier on this year, you spent time ~with my,~ with my mastermind group. You walked this all through. And since [00:10:10] then, I mean, like everyone's, like, we love ai. Like this is exactly what we need in our lives. And so AI for me now is really about me saying in my [00:10:20] zone of genius, that's where I utilize it more than anything else.\n\nI know my zone of genius is writing. I know my zone of genius is creating content to be able to [00:10:30] share to, produce opportunity to be able to get my opinions across, to be able to serve people from a coaching perspective, a mentoring perspective, et cetera, et cetera. And so where [00:10:40] I use ai, I, I would say quite literally 80% of my AI use is in regards to.\n\nIdeation. It's about, I've got an idea for [00:10:50] this type of training. These are the types of people that need this training. This is the problems that they're experiencing right now. And these are sol are the [00:11:00] solutions that I know that I can serve up. Can you help me develop a program that would take four weeks to execute on?\n\nIn one [00:11:10] hour a week~ and,~ and help me put together workbooks or worksheets at the bare minimum to get my point across in order to be able to provide the solutions that I have [00:11:20] planned. These are those solutions. Can you help me? That's where I use the AI most, you know, more than anything else, I'm not asking AI to come up with the solutions for me.\n\nI've [00:11:30] got those after 23 years of entrepreneurship. I don't need AI to help me with that. I know how to help entrepreneurs grow and scale and, ~and ~move their journey forward. I don't need [00:11:40] AI to help me with that at all. What I need AI to help me with is to be able to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible so I can get the training into the hands of my clients.\n\n[00:11:50] Tomorrow rather than 120 days from now, which is, might be what it would take for me to be able to work on everything myself from scratch. Right. So that's really how [00:12:00] I see myself using it, at least, you know? Right, right this second. I think as time goes by~ and you're the expert, not me, but as time goes by,~ I think we will get to a point probably, and it's probably gonna be a lot sooner than [00:12:10] we think where ~ai, you know.~\n\n~We get to the point where~ everything is connected ~and your Amazon account is connected to ai and your grocery store is connected~ to ai. And I'm gonna be, Hey, I've got 12 people coming around for a dinner party. I want four courses including a [00:12:20] great dessert. Four. A mix of meat is ve vegetarians and vegans.\n\nCan you give me three different dishes on three different, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. AI's gonna spit it [00:12:30] out to me. It's gonna order the groceries for me. They're gonna show up without me even having to leave my AI platform. I literally feel like it's gonna get to [00:12:40] that kind of point at some point in the near future.\n\nAnd if that's the case, then we start using it for a lot more than just staying in your zone of genius. But right now, that's what I'm all [00:12:50] I'm all about staying in that zone of genius. \n\nRonsley Vaz: It's already here. ~That's already, that's already here.~ I mean, the states. You can, yeah, there you go. Yeah, ~you can~ you can use chat and connect it to their shopping cart.\n\n~I can't remember what they use there. But it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll do the, the, the, the meal planning. You'll pick the ingredients. Yep. And it'll put things into the shopping cart and wait for you to say yes or no on the amount and stuff like that. See this? ~\n\nChris Ducker: [00:13:00] This is what I'm talking about. This is the stuff that~ I, you know,~ I don't know enough about this part of AI and I, I probably should be looking at.\n\nDiscovering more and more [00:13:10] of it. ~I do recall Christmas morning I was in the kitchen with my wife and I sent an audio message to chat GPT saying something along the lines of, I've got a ham, I've got a Turkey, I've got a roast, potatoes, a whole bunch of veg and I want it all to come out at the exact same time.~\n\n~This is how heavy the Turkey is. This is how big the ham is. Tell me what to do step by step. Idiot's guide to Christmas Day, lunch go, and it spat it out to me almost immediately, and we followed it. To the timing, to the letter, and we had the most incredible lunch because everything was still hot. Nothing had gone cold, and it was all perfect.~\n\n~So, yeah, there you go. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Well, I mean, I think that's it. I feel that's the, it's the augmentation and you know, talking about. Hobbies. I built An ice bath here in, in Goa, and I saw you doing that. Yeah, I saw you doing that. That's awesome. And, and after what happened was the waterproofing layer started to swell up.~\n\n~So I actually went through chat, GPT, and figured out how to fix it, to empty the whole thing, get it scraped out, do it again, put primer there. Absolutely no way I would've done it if I didn't have that access to what to do. In what steps. Take a picture and it could diagnose what happened. Then after I did the bit that it told me to do, it could say, it could, it's not, this is not cleaned up properly.~\n\n~You actually need a wire brush to get out. And I was like, holy shit, there's no way. There's absolutely no way. I would've even completed this. It would've just been lying there half done because I ran into this roadblock. And you know, in the book you talk. See, I think,~ I think at a certain point in every entrepreneurial journey or or lead journey, they come to a point where they go, well, ~what behind, or what, what is it that, what,~ what's [00:13:20] the purpose ~of Right.~\n\nHow does that kind of come in? Because now there are things that you can do that you couldn't do before. Like, for sure, there are things that I can do now that I could not [00:13:30] do before ~it felt like. Learn it.~ And now I Just have,~ you know,~ chat GPT or Claude or whatever else on one side and just~ you know,~ do the thing on the other side and suddenly done.\n\n~Yeah. How do you see, how do you see the, I mean, just~ how you've come through [00:13:40] journey of, you know, virtual freedom. ~You, you've been,~ you've been delegating. I mean, ~I think that's, this is the, I think.~ We gotta learn how to delegate to ai. ~And you've been doing, you know, you are the king of delegation, really.~\n\nChris Ducker: ~I mean, I think, you know, the, the,~ the big thing for me is that we want to get to the [00:13:50] point where ~I. We are mastery. I talk about this in the book, but I talk about it being the, ~the opportunity to be able to master every moment and the fact that long-haul leaders really do make ~the,~ the most of the time that they have both at work as well as in [00:14:00] their personal lives as well.\n\nBecause I think there's been a big push in the entrepreneurial world about the whole kind of work life balance. [00:14:10] Thing. Right? Which by the way, is complete bs. It's a total myth. There's no work life balance anymore. That ended a long, long, long, long time ago. The moment the first [00:14:20] Blackberry came out, work life balance disappeared immediately because we went from starting our jobs at nine in the morning at our desks to [00:14:30] finishing our jobs at five in the afternoon at our desks.\n\nOur time either side of that was our time. We couldn't check email. We you know, we couldn't [00:14:40] sit ~on the, on our, on the train, ~on our commute, replying to emails and all the rest of it. ~Just last week, I went down to London for a couple of in-person interviews at a studio, and I'm sat there at the beginning of the day, rush hour, I think it was around 7 45 in the morning.~\n\n~And to my left, there was a lady working on a PowerPoint presentation on her laptop. And to the right, there was a guy quite irritatingly dictating some sort of report on financial management skills that he was having to put together. And I just thought to myself, what have we got to like, you know, it's not even eight o'clock in the morning.~\n\n~These guys are like all out already. No wonder. They're all exhausted by the end of the week. Right.~ So I think it's about, you know, learning how to be able to master every moment. It's about the importance of upgrading your batteries, knowing [00:14:50] when to push. Right. And when to hustle and when not to, you know, hustle is a season, it's not a lifestyle.\n\nHustle is actually [00:15:00] a good thing. I'm not braiding or, or belittling hustle. ~It's a really, you know, hard work is what we call it, us old people. Right? So hustling is, is a good thing. It's not a bad thing at all,~ but there has to be a line in the sand that's drawn. In terms of an [00:15:10] end point for that hustle.\n\nAnd so the job is to get to that, ~that ~landmark. The job is to get to the end of that project or that deadline, and then pull back and [00:15:20] recalibrate a little bit, hence making it a season. A three month season, or a two week season, or whatever it might be, rather than the normal lifestyle [00:15:30] of us in the leadership world doing what we're doing.\n\nAnd I think this is the issue,~ you know, the, the, the bigger,~ the bigger play here is to build a business, particularly if you're an entrepreneur [00:15:40] or to help build a business that supports your life, not swallow it up. And so if your business feels like it's a black hole. It's probably time to take a look at things and to try [00:15:50] and realign a little bit.\n\nAnd our job is to be able to design that business for want of a better term, around the lifestyle that we want, not the other way around. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I kind of want to,~ [00:16:00] while you were talking, I was thinking about this apart from the hustle culture narrative and the work-life balance narrative, which is obviously rubbish.\n\nThere's this idea of [00:16:10] monetizing your passion, right? So this hobby conversation could easily go down the path of, yeah, oh, you are enjoying it, you should monetize it. Otherwise, it's, is it really useful [00:16:20] doing ~how, how? They like.~ 'cause obviously the first thing, ~one of the first~ that someone's gonna ask ~is gonna,~ is gonna go, oh yeah, people told me that I should monetize my passion.\n\nThat's what my first restaurant, ~what,~ what a waste. [00:16:30] Because ~I didn't,~ this model's better than, but when I think about it~ how would you,~ how would you,~ would you~ reframe that~ if, if at all. ~\n\nChris Ducker: Well, I think, look,~ if you are,~ if you are really, really good at something. You [00:16:40] genuinely enjoy doing it more than anything else that, that you've done in the past, and you see a way of being able to monetize that in a way that doesn't [00:16:50] take away from the love and the passion that you've got for that thing, then it's certainly something that you should spend time thinking about and potentially pursue.\n\nI had a [00:17:00] conversation with my buddy Pat Flynn. Maybe a year ago. And we were FaceTiming and we were walking, I was walking around the the Bonsai garden that I have here. I've got about 50 bonsai trees [00:17:10] here. And I was showing some of my prized possessions right to him. And he turned around and he said to me, man, like, these are really good.\n\nLike you should do a YouTube channel. And I said, you [00:17:20] know, it sounds great. It sounds great to do that, but I know the moment I have to worry about camera angles and lights and mics and [00:17:30] editing and all that kind of stuff is the moment the joy disappears for me in my workshop when it comes to working on a tree and the joy that [00:17:40] I get from doing it is more important to me than any amount of subscribers, followers, or views.\n\n~So I think. It's,~ I think it's a bit of a visceral type of decision that you'll come up with. [00:17:50] You know, just because I like cooking doesn't mean I should open a restaurant. Just because I enjoy swimming doesn't mean I should become a bloody swim coach. ~You know what I mean? ~So it's, it's one of those [00:18:00] things where I, I, I believe that it really is a visceral connection that you have to things.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with looking into it if you feel like it's a genuine opportunity for you, but just be very, very [00:18:10] careful that you don't do something you're gonna end up regretting. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I mean, there's no way for me to have as well, because I feel like I just love cooking for my friends or love, love cooking for people, really.~\n\n~Right, right. And~\n\nChris Ducker: ~I got a good friend of mine who's a great mixologist, great cocktail guy. Makes amazing cocktails. Every time I go around the house, I always know we're gonna have an amazing evening of cocktail tasting. I mean, it will serve up like four or five different cocktails in one evening.~\n\n~Like it's an amazing night. Every single time. But I know he would be a terrible bar owner. Like he would be an awful owner of any kind of establishment like that. So he keeps it to his own bar in his dining room, and he enjoys it with his friends. So I get it entirely. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I mean, it's such a,~ it's such an interesting line.\n\n~The,~ the book and your work has sort of taken you down because I feel like. [00:18:20] you're trying to send such a strong message especially in the art world, because a lot work out there in the marketing world or the entrepreneur world is this works for me so it's gonna work for everyone else.\n\nRight, [00:18:30] right. ~And ~and you are actually saying, well, you know, you should kind of look at yourself and recalibrate yourself. And what, what kind of stuff do you have? ~I mean. But I did not know about your Bonsai election and love for Bon size. ~So [00:18:40] what else did, does Chris Ducker do to kind of recalibrate or keep things in perspective ~of where they're ~\n\nChris Ducker: The biggest thing for me [00:18:50] is being outside in nature. That's the most important And I didn't realize how important it was until I hit that burnout. I've always loved the outdoors and [00:19:00] I'm not a hiker or anything like that, but I mean like being out and about in wildlife and nature. ~When I was a kid, I was nine years old and I remember bringing a hedgehog home.~\n\n~And Harry, it was, that was, that was how incredibly genius of a namer I was for my pet hedgehog, Harry the Hedgehog. As about as original as you can get. But I did, I brought a hedgehog home. We, we kept it in a cardboard box in the kitchen for two days until Harry escaped somehow. I think my father might have had something to do with that and put it back to where he, where he came from.~\n\n~But. I'd forgotten about all of that, to be honest with you. And~ when I hit the burnout part of my recovery process, I was working with a naturopathic doctor~ in regards to lifestyle choices, supplementation, that kind of stuff.~ And [00:19:10] she said to me, ~and I talk about this journey with her very specifically in the book actually.~\n\n~She said to me,~ you've gotta get out into nature every single day. One hour, no AirPods, no podcasts, nothing like that. Just get out into nature and enjoy some fresh air. Listen to the [00:19:20] birds, you know, feel the ground under your feet. Just get out and enjoy it for an hour every single day. It's gonna do a world of good for your stress levels and all the rest of it.\n\nSo I was [00:19:30] like, okay, alright, whatever. ~I'll,~ I'll start walking outside kind It didn't take me long. To fall back in love E everything started coming back to me ~and I was, I was born about a 10 minute walk from Wimbledon Common in London. So I spent a lot of time on the common growing up. ~And it didn't take long for, [00:19:40] for me to kind of go back to that place of happiness and, Discovery and all the rest of it. And I kept coming back ~and,~ and telling my wife about, you know, I saw this bird and I [00:19:50] saw this squirrel and this, that and the other. And she said, well, we've got that old DSLR camera that we never use. Why don't you take it out and take photos of these birds you keep ~talk ~talking about?\n\nSo I [00:20:00] did, and I did that for about six to eight weeks or so until I realized I needed a much, much better camera set up. So, like I said, I've become a little obsessive, [00:20:10] went all in. And ended up buying a four and a half thousand pound wildlife photography set up. Which I'm now the guy walking around with this 600 mil lens,~ you know, in the woods kind of thing, you know, like this. ~And so. [00:20:20] Being out in nature, taking photos of wildlife, particularly birds, is a big passion of mine now.~ And if I must say if I must say myself, I'm becoming to get quite bloody good at it as well.~\n\nAnd so, for me, that's the non-negotiable, is that daily walk [00:20:30] outside.~ If it's torrential, downpour, no, I'll leave it and you know, catch up the next day. But other than that, I'm, I'm outside pretty much every day ~and that's important to \n\nme. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~That's great that you found that, that you, that you found that, I mean, it's such a, it's such a blessing when you find something that you're in love with, that you don't even really care how much you spend on.~\n\n~Yeah. And you keep spending on it and it's like, it gives you so much joy. I, I wanna, I wanna land this plane~ in the book. You talk about every Yes. Is a no. What, yeah. I, I feel like. That's something [00:20:40] that we learn later on,~ in, in,~ in our careers. Sometimes we don't learn that at all. Mm-hmm. I've just conversations with a lot of people who were like, why aren't you saying no to stuff?\n\nAnd I'm like. I can, [00:20:50] I didn't even know that I could say no to stuff. Right. Yeah. So like, ~what kinda ~what kind of advice do you have for people who are like natural people pleasers or maybe they don't even know they're natural people [00:21:00] pleasers, just know. Well, \n\nChris Ducker: that's the believe I'm a reformed people pleaser like I used to say yes to.\n\nEveryone for everything, [00:21:10] literally. And I was working with, ~with ~one of my mentors who's unfortunately no longer with us, a gentleman under the name of Dan Miller. And he led me down [00:21:20] this path of the power of saying no. And I realized the moment I started saying no to things that didn't align or it wasn't the right timing or whatever it was that it [00:21:30] created this lift.\n\nMentally, it was like having less things on my schedule less stress, less worry, less concern,~ et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.~ And it hit me, holy moly, like, [00:21:40] yes, my yeses are a commodity. They really are. Every time I say yes to doing an interview like this, for example, I'm saying no to something else. [00:21:50] So if my yeses are also nos, how powerful does that become in my day-to-day life, not just at work, but also in my private life as well.\n\nAnd so we [00:22:00] started looking at that a lot more and ~we, we,~ we talked about this, when you say yes to something, you say no to something else at the exact same time. When you say yes, doing that late meeting at work, you're saying no. To [00:22:10] that soccer match for your boy at school or when you say yes to you know that a prolonged family vacation, you are saying no [00:22:20] to potentially that work commitment or that conference that you could have gone to or that speaking gig you could have had.\n\nSo ~it's, it's a not,~ it's a never ending cycle of making the [00:22:30] right decisions for the right things for you. And that's why it's so important. It's so personal, it's so visceral. It's a word I've been using a lot. In the last year visceral [00:22:40] because it means in your very being like deep down inside. And so my advice is for anybody that does have problems [00:22:50] saying no is to quite literally just start doing it.\n\nIn fact, actually, here's your permission slip. I'm writing it to you right now. Say no [00:23:00] to everything for the next 30 days. Blanket, no. Everything for the next 30 days and see how light it makes you [00:23:10] feel. \n\nRonsley Vaz: Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, ~you should go.~ You should go check out the book. It's an absolute. Amazing read.\n\n~I've read it. I've read,~ I've got a chance to read it a a lot earlier on and it just absolutely, [00:23:20] even though you think, okay, I've read a lot of leadership books, but, you know, you've got to check when you get the book. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you've gotta check out the Life OS framework.\n\nIt is [00:23:30] absolutely amazing. It teaches you some really cool strategies that will help you live better and live in the way we've been talking about through this conversation. Chris, thank you so much. For the [00:23:40] time, for the conversation. Every time we have a conversation, it's such a a little loss of heaven.\n\nThanks, mate. \n\nChris Ducker: Appreciate you, my man. Thank you very much. \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Thanks, buddy. That was great. I loved it. Cool. ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~Rock and roll. Well, you got another one to do. You better. You better shoot. We'll will I will. When are you gonna drop this? ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~I'm gonna try and do it next week, but we're gonna, we're gonna see if we can do a double one.~\n\n~So if I'm gonna give that to the, to the content team and see if they can do this as an audio documentary on psychology of entrepreneurship as well. ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~Okay. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, they'll go through the content and see how that works, but we'll try and get it out next week. That'd be good. I ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~mean, literally the, the launch is next week, so that'd be great.~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah, we are aware. If, if not then an email will go out next week and the so will go following ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~Appreciate it. Appreciate it, man. That's awesome. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~All I've introduced Chloe and you to Evan Peyton's podcast guy to see. Okay. He was like do you know anyone that I was like, fucking Chris would get on any podcast right now, I think for his book.~\n\n~So, ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~yeah. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Have a, I know ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~Evan, I've, I've not spoken to Evan before, but I know of him and his work and all that kind of stuff, so, ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~yeah. Okay, great. So I think I've already made that introduction and appreciate that. Yeah, let me know let me know. I mean, you're doing already a lot of so,~\n\nChris Ducker: ~well, if you can think of anybody that would be a good fit for the message of the book.~\n\n~It doesn't need to be business, you know, it could be. Lifestyle. It can be health, it can be whatever you think, you know, if, you know, if you have an in on a decent show, just let me know what it is and I'll let you know whether I need, whether I'd like an intro. That'd be awesome. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah, I mean, we've helped out a few.~\n\n~The Darren who comes to mind he, he, he is it's called a Darren Ali. He was, zach Efron's, he was with Zaffron in Down To Earth on Netflix. Okay. Was that his, one of his? But he's got a couple of books. One's called Super Life, one's called Fatal Conveniences, which we started, we helped launch and everything.~\n\n~So, that sounds ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~great. I'd, I'd love that intro. That'd be awesome. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Yeah. I, I, I, again, you know, I'll make the intro. I just don't know how they, they'll, they'll go through his team and stuff, but you never know what, what, what it turns out to be. I'll also send him a text message and, and let him know.~\n\n~Awesome. And ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~sounds good man. Sounds good. Alright brother, well look, I'll let you shoot to your next call. I appreciate you having me on and all that good stuff and we'll catch up again soon. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Sounds great. Alright brother. ~\n\nChris Ducker: ~Talk to you soon man. Thank you. ~\n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Bye. Cheers. Bye.~"

    "transcript": "145\n===\n\n​[00:00:00] \n\nRonsley Vaz: ~Amplify ai episode I should check I should check.~\n\n~1 43, 1 44, episode 1 44.~\n\n~In the last episode of this podcast, I showed you the Presu Asian Framework Matrix, and if you don't know what that is, I highly recommend you take 17 minutes or maybe less of your time and go watch that. It is how good marketing. Makes it easy to sell. It's called Presion. It's a note I wrote. You'll find the whole story in the previous episode, but now I'm gonna show you how to do it.~\n\n~I have the whole checklist. We're gonna do it together. And also, if you want this checklist and all the prompts that I use to create this yourself, just comment. Checklist below and my team is gonna get you a copy. So whether you find that on YouTube or Instagram or LinkedIn, it doesn't matter. Comment checklist below and we'll get you all the details today.~\n\n~I'm gonna show you how to do this in real time, and I'm gonna do it side by side so we can do this together. Alright, come, let's learn.~\n\nSo just again, a refresher. This is the matrix.~ It is basically how you take your team or your cl No, sorry. It, it, it,~ it basically is how you take [00:00:10] your clients from being in a latent and low trust space to being active and high trust. All the way to [00:00:20] orchestrating ~the ~the yes where their buy intent is high and they believe what you say.\n\nThe trust and proof is high. So I covered the whole thing in the last [00:00:30] episode,~ but I'm not gonna go into, into each one of them.~ In the next episode, I'm going to do exactly like this one side by side with all the prompts and the checklist on creating these assets. A three [00:00:40] minute quick win, a calculator and a swipeable checklist.\n\nSo if you are in a position where you are thinking ~what kind of.~ What kind of marketing should I create so that [00:00:50] I can sell easier in my business? These episodes are for you, starting with the Presu agent framework that I covered last time, followed by this one, and [00:01:00] then the ones that come after this because I'm gonna show you how to create these assets that allow your audience to actually get results and [00:01:10] also move into this high proof.\n\nTrust area. ~Okay, let me share my screen.~\n\n~I'm not sure why that was muted, but~\n\n~Okay. Let me move this here. Close this and maybe move this here.~\n\n~Alright, team. Just, just some.~\n\n~Yeah. Anyway, let's just go back to Edith~\n\n~New chat.~\n\n~Okay. So the goal for today is to create a framework.~\n\n~Lemme start again.~\n\n~Actually.~\n\nSo the goal today is for you to create your own ~matrix~ [00:01:20] pre persuasion framework matrix, where you know what kind of assets you need to create in each of these areas for your [00:01:30] business and how it work for you and your audience and your clients, and your. People and your outcome and your transformation.\n\nSo this is how to [00:01:40] create one like this for yourself and your business. ~Let's do this.~\n\nSo the checklist, and I'll give you ~a ~a rough idea on how this works, right? The first we're gonna define the audience and then [00:01:50] create the two by two matrix for yourself. Then we're gonna pick an asset. In each quadrant, or multiple assets in each quadrant, we're gonna lock in the [00:02:00] KPIs that determine that asset and what success looks like.\n\nFor that, we're gonna define what your call to action is and then track and make sure it is [00:02:10] ethically and safety bound. Right? So let's do this in steps. The first thing is we're gonna create a ideal client profile and a friction clarifier. So [00:02:20] what we'll do first is we'll just go copy this, okay? Now.\n\n~I'll, I,~ I spoke about Edith. And Edith is our~ is our,~\n\n~our~ autonomous~ triage helper,~ intelligent triage helper. Edith actually stands [00:02:30] for Amplify ai, ethically driven intelligent triage helper. So we have our own version of, ~of ~Edith that has a lot of. [00:02:40] Already, you know, our thoughts, our ideas our brand guidelines, a whole bunch of different things. And in, in one of the upcoming episodes, I'm gonna show you how to create, ~edit,~ and edit for yourself,~ I suppose.~\n\n~But~ I'm gonna go [00:02:50] into this little, and we have different versions of that. I'm just gonna ~paste,~ copy and paste. This here. ~All right. ~So here I'm gonna change this to what we sell. And obviously [00:03:00] you do that for yourself. In here I'm gonna say custom AI software solutions . We create AI team members is to make [00:03:10] the business more human.\n\nTo allow the human team to do their work easier, faster, and Price points. Your project history. [00:03:20] Now, the reason I'm using edit, which you don't really have to you can just start from scratch and just define this yourself. Look at your project files [00:03:30] actually, ' cause this is already in there.\n\nUse your project files to determine. So that's the advantage of kind of having this. So basically I'm gonna start and you just [00:03:40] fill in your version. And what we're doing right now is we are kind of getting your ICP and ~you're trying to,~ we're trying to get what creates friction. So. It found my ICP [00:03:50] founders of one to $10 million service businesses with 25 to 20 staff who need faster growth and efficiency now, and who control budgets of 25,000 and above.\n\nRight? [00:04:00] Their biggest pain points are they probably have to rewrite proposals that are over 30 minutes. Chase follow ups. Produce content and all this have signals and all this have [00:04:10] triggers, and these are blind spots. Which is basically assumptions that I should check before I go ahead. So right now what it's done is it's created an ICP line, which [00:04:20] is a ideal client profile three roll table of their pain points, and~ a a~ a couple of questions to check.\n\nSo the next thing I want to do is I kind of [00:04:30] want it to, use those pain points to create buying triggers. Okay? So for example, tender deadline is in [00:04:40] less than 45 days. Email invite or calendar block mark proposal due. So this proof, right? So what is the trigger? End of quarter revenue gap. Key sales person.\n\nResigns [00:04:50] marketing campaign launches in 30 days. Investor board meetings in 60 days. So who feels it first? What's the urgency? ~ and how This. Triggers how,~ how there are five concise triggers and [00:05:00] observable proofs and matching calls to action. Okay, that's here. ~Let,~ let's automate proposals so you never have to miss a deadline again.\n\nRun AI follow ups now to close deals [00:05:10] this quarter. Install an AI assistant ~to assistant~ to pick up admin load immediately. So we build all these ais that like just run in the background and you never have to worry about them again because they're just [00:05:20] doing the thing that it's supposed to. Then the next thing~ we want~ is from there, we want to create ~your ~your matrix.\n\nOkay? So just copy and paste this, the buy intent and trust proof [00:05:30] matrix, and just ~hit,~ literally hit that. what it'll do is four tidy sections of the different sections in the matrix. So if you can see. ~My ma~ the matrix, [00:05:40] you'll see Q1 at the bottom. Q2 ~is,~ is at the bottom as well, border authority, and then the Q3 and Q4 is up the top.\n\nSo in prime pattern, the audience snapshot founder is curious [00:05:50] about AI, but not feeling the pain strongly yet. The main objection is we're not sure AI is relevant to our size and team proof needed. So they're really in the bottom where ~they're,~ they're latent in buying. Not ready to buy [00:06:00] yet. And they're also low in trust.\n\nThey don't know ~who to ~who to trust. Three key asset types are short explainer videos, benchmark PDFs and bot misting posts. The one KPI is [00:06:10] the percentage of content downloads from cold traffic. We already have ~a,~ a AI team member called Scout and it kind of. Scouts out the market signal ~and it,~ and the signals that come in from the [00:06:20] market and summarizes it for Again, I'll talk about that and show you how to do that~ in a, in a,~ in a following video. Then this is for us, right? This will change for you each one of these sections. So in Board of [00:06:30] Authority, the audience is the founder with urgent pain. Their sales have dropped, but they have no prior relationship with us because ~they're,~ they're active in terms of buying intent, but they're low on trust.\n\n[00:06:40] The ~main, main,~ main objection here is why should they trust us? And the proof is what we need is third party endorsements. Client, ROI. Stats, like publish testimonials. The three types of [00:06:50] assets to create here are case study decks, podcast guesting on other shows and, you know, LinkedIn carousels with metrics.\n\nNumber one KPI ~to ~track is the number of [00:07:00] inbound demos booked from new leads. And we already have a AI teammate that kind of does this ~. It's.~ It's called radar. And Radar does competitive [00:07:10] analysis and market intelligence, which is kind of cool. So imagine like we've got scouting radar just operating all the time and giving us results.\n\nAgain, in the upcoming videos. I'm gonna show you how to [00:07:20] create these yourself. We're moving high into the trust area, but low on the latency in terms of buying intent. And the audience snapshot is that ~snapshot is that~ they're warm network who already [00:07:30] know and rate me or us but they don't feel a fired act yet.\n\nSo the main objection is, looks great, but timing isn't. The proof needed is light touch experiments [00:07:40] showing easy wins. Three asset types in this category ~for,~ for us is, you know, pilot offer, invite, ROI calculator. Actually ~, We are,~ we are building a calculator right now on how much it'll [00:07:50] cost you to just do nothing.\n\nSo there's a few there that will, that can be used. The number one KPI to track in this area, in this quadrant for us [00:08:00] is the number of warm leads moving into pilot. ~In, in,~ into the proof of concept area. ~And,~ and we already have ~a,~ a teammate that does personalized content generation. So, ~y~ you know, [00:08:10] again, you can create these.\n\nAI teammates that actually help you do certain things. And finally up the top, we to orchestrate ~the,~ the, yes, they're already [00:08:20] high in trust. They know what we do, and they're active in terms of buying intent they wanna buy. Now they're a trusted founder ~that, that con they're a trusted founder~ that actually want to get something done in the [00:08:30] next to 60 days. And the main objection at this point is, will this deliver fast enough to matter? Now the proof needed is speed to value, proof, and a 30 day implementation plan. The three [00:08:40] types of assets that we should create here, the implementation timeline, guarantee offer, and video walkthrough.\n\nThe key KPI here is deal cycle length. How long does it take from first call to [00:08:50] signed? And we have Victor, who actually is a deal closing assistant that helps you. So, ~so each~ in the next few episodes, ~you know, following,~ I'm gonna show you how ~we create,~ gonna create each of these [00:09:00] assets for ourself.\n\nBut. Again, ~I,~ if you want this whole checklist, just let me know. So, after it's created, the presu agent matrix, the next thing I want is a [00:09:10] score table of the top three assets to create and, ~and, and~ where they fit in. ~So.~\n\nSo it's done this really good job of looking at all the different things and said to me, all right, well [00:09:20] the first thing I've gotta actually build this week is this direct deal closing asset. It's needed for urgent prospects. The next thing I gotta build is a case study deck, so ~to,~ to [00:09:30] build trust and compound sales proof.\n\nAnd the next thing I gotta build is a benchmark PDF, which we already have by the way. And you can find that at scorecard [00:09:40] dot the amplify ai.com. Faster ship captures coal interest. ~We,~ we've got this and it does a whole audit ~on ~on a business. So after you are going [00:09:50] through your own version of this, \n\nI want you to just copy and paste all these things. So each quadrant define KPI ~inputs.~\n\n~See above.~ And. You know, the team has done a great job in terms of [00:10:00] putting this together in a way that you just have to copy and paste it. So if you want this whole playbook and this prompt stack comment checklist below and a team [00:10:10] will find a way to get that to you. So for each one of those quadrants, now you should have, you know, four short sections plus a neat KPI table [00:10:20] with formulas and sources. So what does it take for each one of the things? So the KPIs and what benchmarks ~to,~ to keep track of. And then what [00:10:30] we want is your style and tone. ~Now I am messaging Edith and.~\n\n~So iMessaging Edith, I just hope this is still working. Let me check audio test. Still recording. Okay,~\n\n~so I. Where am I? Yeah,~ so I'm messaging Edith and Edith kind of has some of our messaging styles already inside her. but what I want are some call to [00:10:40] actions and, ~and ~if you're doing it in your own version, you should be able to, have these, so ~it,~ it'll create call to actions for, what we're trying to create, and then it'll make sure that it'll [00:10:50] create voice and guardrails.\n\nSo what I've kind of basically done here is~ is ~given you a step by step way to create your own version of persuasion [00:11:00] and the different assets required to take someone. Who's in your audience from a very low point in terms of trust and buying [00:11:10] intent to a high point where they trust and value what you are doing and also are very ready to buy.\n\nSo this is the full, ~the full~ playbook and we kind of [00:11:20] execute them one after the other. And it's done a really great job, not only at doing that, but finally landing up with this voice and guardrails card that says do's and [00:11:30] don't for ~what? ~How I want it to behave what to do, what not to do, what checklist to look at and, ~and ~how to create it.\n\n~So, i. In the next episode I'm gonna show you how to create assets at speed. We're gonna create the bottom assets, which are for audience that don't know who we are in, in terms of trust and proof, and they're also low in the intent buying intent scale. What kind of assets should we create for them?~\n\n~I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna create mine and we can do that together just like we did today. I'll see you in the next episode. Check out some of the previous ones because there's a lot of really cool stuff that we've done. Call to action. So this piece here is a call to action for psychology of entrepreneurship.~\n\n~Hey, it's Ronsley. I'm so glad that you joined us on this episode. Of volume, of psychology, of entrepreneurship. It takes a long time for us to put these together and we hope you enjoy the process that has taken us to deliver this story type of podcasts to decipher what it takes to be an entrepreneur. We have an amazing catalog, back catalog of episodes that you should go and check out, but also we have a podcast called.~\n\n~Amplify ai, which if you Google, you should find, it's about how to use AI in your business as an entrepreneur, as a business owner to scale at speed, but also to keep authentic behaviors of who you are and what you do. The idea is to create AI team members that help humans do their job better, faster, and easier.~\n\n~I'll catch you in the next episode. I'll catch you in a following up.~\n\n~I'll hopefully catch you on the other podcast, but thank you for listening. I hope you can make that a~\n\n~call to action for psychology of entrepreneurship. Alright, finish. End recording.~"
