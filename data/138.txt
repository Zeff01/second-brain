Ronsley Vaz: [00:00:00] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm with Simon Bowen,

I'm very jealous of the way he thinks, primarily because he's known for his models. And if you've ever seen anyone use models in the way they describe things and the way they sell and the way they portray how they do their work, then it's probably a Simon bone invention. So he's the host of the wisdom of new into the podcasting game.

I, I suppose, considering all things considered, but the brains on this man is something that I am very jealous of, and I hope that when I grow up, I am somewhere close to a Simon Bowen. So, Simon, thank you for joining us. This has been really cool. Look, it's an absolute pleasure. I wanna start with this models, I, you know, concept.

And I feel like everyone these days have some sort of models primarily because it is such a simple way to explain what you do. Can you give us a, a, breakdown of what that means? I mean, I feel like I'm butchering that idea, but maybe you have a [00:01:00] better way to explain what the model's method is.

Sure. Can I draw

Simon Bowen: a model to explain that? Would that be a Yes? You can. Okay. So, you know, when we think about how people communicate, look, first of all, let me actually just say right up front, particularly for people in business, okay. When we use the word system in business, you know, generally people think about your sales system or your finance system or whatever.

The two most important systems in any business are the system for thinking. The system for influence. So the system for thinking is the quality of the idea on which the business is built. A business is only as good as the idea on which it's built and the quality of the leaders running that business.

And then the system for influence is your ability to influence the choices people make customers to buy from you staff to work hard for you, suppliers to serve you banks, to fund you, regulators, to let you operate. And so you know it. When we have a robust system for thinking and [00:02:00] influence, we have the ability to think deeper than everybody else.

I, I'd love people to write this down. Depth of thinking is the only true market differentiation there actually is. When you go to market with a deeper thought around the problem you solve than anybody else, you are automatically differentiated. Right. But we've bought into this marketing story that is, well, the customer knows what they want, ask them and give it to them.

That is actually not true. Now, in, a medical setting, like a doctor is a salesperson, they have to get you to say, have surgery or go into a treatment plan or something like that. I had a pretty catastrophic back injury that you know about. And you know, when the surgeon's saying, you need surgery, Simon, everything in my mind is going, don't, you're not operating on my back.

Right. And if he'd asked me what I wanted, I would've just said, let's do some physio. And I probably would've been in a wheelchair or walking with a frame. But he said, you need surgery and this is why. And I've had about a 98% recovery. So [00:03:00] oftentimes the customer actually, if the customer doesn't know what is available.

How can they inform you about what they want and in a complex sale? So if we think about what is a complex sale, A complex sale is, you know, when there's you, you have this ability to solve a problem in a way that other people don't understand. And then there's them, the customer, now they have whole chunks of their world over here that they're not telling you about.

It's private to them. Their preferences, their priorities, their affordability et cetera, et cetera. Their fears, their concerns, and you have a whole chunk of stuff over here that you know about that they don't know about. And so the only bit that really matters when we are saying, oh, we'll find out what the customer wants and just give it to them is this bit in the middle in, because they already know that.

I mean, they already understand that bit and you understand that bit. There is no value in here ' cause it's just labor for hire. There's [00:04:00] no insight, there's nothing new. There's no but when you can say, Hey, if you were to have a problem out here, I'm not saying you do, but if you were to have a problem out here this thing here could fix that.

Do you want to know more? That's called the complex sale, right? And so we've traditionally used words only to sell to the world industrial. I call it industrial age selling. It came from foot in the door selling. In 1966, these two guys did a study into what they called the Yes ladder. Like get the customer to say yes.

You get the customer to do one small thing, they do another slightly bigger thing. And door to door salespeople used to wear shoes that had the sole of the shoe was wider than the actual foot of the shoe, so that once the door was open, they could put the foot in the door and the customer could keep slamming the door on your foot and they couldn't get the door shut.

Now you can keep shouting your pitch at the customer inside the door, and it's fundamentally, you and I have a real alignment on the need for, you know, more noble business and enterprise. [00:05:00] But this is a fundamentally disrespectful way of selling, right? A very confront, even the word pitch, right sales pitch.

A pitch is what a pitcher in baseball does to get the batter out. Why do we use the word pitch, right? You think about all the language, right close. it's the opening of a relationship, but we close them and all of this sort of business. So generally, the gift of the gab, someone that can just talk you in to a sale, right?

And so we've relied heavily on language only. And the problem with that is if we think about humans and we use words only to communicate with people, that is a red zone down here. And when you use words only people say, well, I hear you. But it's all just noise. Anyone that's had teenage kids knows this world super well, right?

Yeah, I hear you. But like, could you tidy up your room, please? I get that. So that, to me, that means sometime this month, right? I heard you, but it's actually just noise, right? and [00:06:00] interestingly, only about 11% of the information that the human brain brings in from the world outside comes in through the auditory channels, through the ears.

Only 11% about 3% is taste, 1% is smell. I think about three or something percent is touch. So that leaves, it leaves. About 83% of the information's world comes in through the optic nerve. 55% of the brain's reflex reaction is attached directly to the optic nerve. And so if we can increase the visual access to our ideas for people.

If we can show it to them rather than tell it to them, we move up into this top quadrant where people say, well, I see. And what I see is always more interesting than what I hear. Remember, that soccer team of boys that got stuck in the cave in Thailand? Yes. And the cave was gonna flood. Right. And I heard that news story on the radio in the car when it first broke out.

And I've gotta admit, I'm thinking, well, you walked in, walk out before the floods come. I don't get it. Like you walked into the cave walk out. [00:07:00] So I heard it didn't connect. Then I saw the, you know, the picture on TV of, oh well this is what the cable Oh, okay. So much more interesting. On the other side of that, if we can increase structural, what I call structural access, so the human brain is a meaning making machine and people wanna make sense of.

What you are talking about. They don't just wanna be told this will solve your problem. The next question is, Hey, this thing would solve your problem over here. Okay, well I need to make sense of that. What is the structure of that? When we give people structural access, they move over to this side where they're basically saying why I get it?

And that's believable because it has structure. Now this model that I'm drawing for you at the moment is a model that I made up, but because it's a model, it's more believable than if I was just talking about this stuff right now. I've put some data in there and, but I built the model, And then in the top right corner up here where people say, Hey, listen, I see and it's interesting and I [00:08:00] get it, and it's believable.

where I see and I get it, it becomes desirable. And so that by itself is interesting. what we added to the models, which is really I think where we took models to another level, we exposed this super green zone up in the top right quadrant. And what just happened then, by the way, is what I call a punchline.

A punchline is when you walk people through some scenarios and paradigms and then you open up a conversation they didn't see coming. There's this super green zone, this secret zone in the model where if we add great choreography to this The way we walk through the model, and I base that on stage magic and comedy, which are the two performing arts, designed to create curiosity, which is the most powerful state to put somebody into if you're trying to influence them by desirable becomes viable.

And you don't, need to resort to industrial age selling false pressure, scarcity, urgency. You just show people what is actually going on. So for example, I could wrap this [00:09:00] very quickly as a sale if I want to do that and say, so do you want me to show you how to sell in the top right corner of that matrix?

And if you do sign up here, you know, this is what we're doing, blah, blah, blah. This is how we make that happen. And in one model, I've just taken everything else out of play that they might be doing and shift 'em the top right quadrant. So the way we communicate. And we're taught to communicate in school.

It just has huge gaps all the way through it, right? Yeah. And so as soon as you start drawing, you draw people in. When you give them a visual model, they get visual access. It's interesting when you put structure to it. And by the way, this item one, item two, item three, item four, that's not a model, that's a list shown visually.

This is also not a model, that's a list shown as a visual diagram. what makes this a model is when you actually articulate the dimensions of the model, you talk about the interactions between the parts, you [00:10:00] actually use dimensionality. Direction through the model. And, have a method and showing people why the geometry actually matters.

And so a lot of people go , I've got a model and they show me, you know, three circles with words. And I go, that's not a model, right? What is it? An inward moving circle or an outward moving circle? And what's happening on this line? And what's happening on that line? So why is it three circles, one inside the other?

Why doesn't it look like this?

Like explain that to me. You know, or people will go, you know, I've got this model where, you know, go from A to B and I go, great, explain the arrow. You didn't label the arrow, you didn't tell me what the arrow's there for. Like, people bring models to me all the time and I'm going, it's not a model.

So when you think about structure and giving people structural access, that's what the geometry actually does. So if I can steal a little bit more time and then let you ask another question. The other reason for this is if we, humans are interesting, humans have an intensity about them from high to low.

And when we want to influence people, we are gonna apply a certain amount of time and [00:11:00] energy to try and influence them. And what we know for certain is that humans have a naturally high intensity for resistance.

Ronsley Vaz: Yeah.

Simon Bowen: They have a hardwired system for saying no. Right? And they have a low intensity for acceptance.

We do not have an automatic system for saying yes. And the proof of is simple. You know, you go into a shop, someone says, may I help you? You go, no thanks. Just look. Right? And then three minutes later you'll go up to that shopper system while they're talking to somebody else and interrupt 'em and go, do you have one of these?

Right? Or someone says, Ronsley, that's amazing. You are incredible. Thank you. And you go, it's nothing. 'cause we're not good at acceptance, right? in selling conversion is the moment these curves. Reverse conversion is when the resistance curve collapses and the acceptance curve rises. That's when conversion occurs.

Now the payment is out here, but the conversion to the idea, to the value occurs [00:12:00] first. And so in order to make that happen with the least amount of time and effort people get in here to try and make that happen sooner. And they use false scarcity, urgency and pressure. They pressure sell. Now, if you put pressure inside a closed vessel, you just push the side further apart.

Yeah. I happen to discover that if I put a visual model in front of somebody, this is me, this is them, and I put a visual model on 'em, and we work together on the model. The model does the convincing, the model does the heavy lifting. It's not me to them, it's me and them working together on a model

The model becomes the idea that they can buy, and there's a reason for that. And then that positions me on the other side out here where instead of selling, I can just facilitate. So once I've got them. To the idea. Now I can just facilitate what this looks like to buy from us. So you want that model.

Great. But let's work out how we could make this happen together. And the reason this shift where you get the model to do the [00:13:00] heavy lifting, what you really do is you're making the model, the mediator between two people. And once, you know, two people often don't reach agreement on something, but two people that have a mediator in between do, and you make the model, the mediator and the model does the heavy lifting.

And so we can both pour in on the model together. And if they fill in parts of the model with their words, I'm gonna use their words, not mine. It's hard for people to disagree with a model that they helped to build. Right? And so, you know, it's a medium for thinking and bring people along on the thinking journey.

And then for influence, so. Slightly long explanation, but it's why models work. They are a system for thinking and influence.

Ronsley Vaz: That is an episode in itself. I, it's just absolutely, you know, like you mentioned, the depth of thinking there is insane. And I want to actually really want to get into how you think, because I think that's, that's a very, for me, that would be selfish.

But you mentioned some, a couple of things that I wanna talk about. [00:14:00] Firstly, the reflexes on the optic nerve. Yeah. I would not have my left eye if the reflexes on my optic nerve was not connected. 'cause I was walking up the Glasshouse Mountains for a climb and Mount gon, and I did not see that someone broke off a branch and I was walking.

And I, I wouldn't have, like, there's no way that Ronsley could see that, but my eye was so quick and it shot at the right time. But that, that broken stick went Yeah. Into the eyelid instead of the eye. And I can totally attest to this optic nerve being like the reflexes that Yeah. You know, it's absolutely spot on.

Yeah. The second thing that you mentioned that I feel like the rest of the podcast should be dedicated to is communication. Sure. I feel like that is the key to everything, in my opinion. Whether we communicate to people the way you are or we communicating to artificial intelligence, we want to be able to communicate in the right way to get the [00:15:00] results that we are after.

So. Let's go down that path, if you don't mind. Sure. Yeah. And let's talk about communication. How have you seen, I mean, you've been obviously very good at communicating thoughts, ideas depth of thinking is ridiculous. You know, I thought I had depth of thinking, but listening to you for the first 20 minutes was like, whoa, you know, I have so much to learn.

So when you've been using ai, how have you been able to communicate what you want? What has your experience been like?

Simon Bowen: actually I have a great little story about ai. That's only just happened this week, by the way. Yeah, totally. Friends of ours have an elderly mother who's on an oxygen machine. And the oxygen machine stopped working on the weekend.

And really all you can do when that happens is call an ambulance and get them to come out as fast as possible.

But our friends jumped into chat. He has the side button on his phone, set up to run chat. He jumped in the chat and said. My mother's oxygen machine has stopped working. Do you have any suggestions?

Chad said, what brand is the machine and what model? And he told it and it said, okay, here's some things you can [00:16:00] do. And it gave him a hack using items from the kitchen and a sponge and freezer space and things like that to keep her being fed with oxygen until the ambulance arrived. AI probably saved a life, but ai, what machine?

Give me the model and everything. So here's something you and it came up with all these suggestions. Go figure. So the world's changed, right? And I think one of the ways a lot of people see AI and you know, I think generally speaking, when people think ai, they think chat you. And I know AI is so much more than that.

In fact, AI's had a long tail. It's been around for much longer than people realize. It just launched in November 22, I think, into a form that most people get their hands on. And so people become a bit obsessed about be becoming prompt engineers. So let's just talk about the chat tools becoming prompt engineers to get good quality output out of chat.

The first thing I do before I ask chat to do something is draw a [00:17:00] model. I literally just hand draw a model and put it into chat and explain the model to chat, and then I ask it to do the task. And I get significantly higher quality output out of it than I do from any written prompt. Sometimes these days I'll draw a model, put it in the chat and say, could you write me an email about that?

And it just spits out incredible stuff. And then I take it and put some wisdom juice over it. So the problem with AI is it's a large language model. Mm-hmm. And it's not a large insight model. And so the problem is that, you know, we've got now got more noise than we've ever had before, and communication is a human activity.

Ronsley Vaz: Mm-hmm.

Simon Bowen: If you think about it, you're communicating with another human to influence them. You've done some thinking. Here's something you'd like to make happen. Now you need to influence some other people. Right? So communication is a human activity. Increasingly AI [00:18:00] can manage some of that communication.

you know, I, I think about, AI in terms of where is the AI line? So the technology line, and let's just say today that's the AI line had, you know, has things above the line and below the line. Now, typically anything that is below the tech line amounts to human replacement.

So the industrial age was a form of technology. The tech line came from the industrial age and it replaced human labor, right? But everything above that tech line should be human enhancement. And of course, as that line rises. It wipes out all the human stuff that falls below it and makes that replaceable, right?

Or, you know, if we think about things like conscience, compassion, context communication, I would've said in, a lot of communication was above the line. You know, with AI agents and things like that, that now is potentially falling [00:19:00] below the line. You know, connection. These are things that above the line, but concepts, constructs.

one of the things that is still above the line is contrast. It's still a human notion to think about. What is it not? So, you know, if you're putting some marketing stuff into chat, for example, to come up with some marketing ideas, seldom does chat give you information back that says it is not this, which is useful stuff to talk to people about.

Right. Content, all these things now are below the line. if you work in this world, you've gotta figure out how to get into this world.

Ronsley Vaz: Mm-hmm. And of

Simon Bowen: course we all know the existential debate about conscience and compassion and all of these sorts of things, but you know, the AI line is moving all the time.

And one of the things that we need to understand about the technology line is it never stops and it never goes away. 'cause humans are inventive. We keep creating. And so, you know, we need to figure out how to use these tools in a responsible and powerful way. But I know that if I do my [00:20:00] thinking first and then pop a model in front of, an AI tool. I get a much more solid body of work outta that. Now, I'm not sure you would know this better than I, but I heard somewhere that the estimate is that AI would've consumed all human created content by 2026 or seven or something ridiculous like

Ronsley Vaz: that.

Simon Bowen: Well, if that's the case, everyone's gonna sound the same.

There's gonna be lots and lots of noise. There already is, and everyone's gonna sound the same. And so this is particularly true, important for founders. How do you let this part of you show up? Yeah, and of course, we do that through this thing that we call the genius model. We, capture the genius of a company in a single model that you can explain in seven minutes that contains the founder's originality inside that model, and then go from there.

if you taught me to treat chat as a like to have a collaboration with it, right. And have a conversation with it. And then I went, well I'm gonna pump models in there 'cause that's how I [00:21:00] see and hear the world. Right? Yeah. And turns out chat quite likes that. And so does Claude and all these others, right?

And in fact, these days, the very first thing it does when I pump a model in there is give me a breakdown of the model of how it's understood it. So chat's first action is to give me feedback on this is what I think you've just said to me. Explain to me. Now that's useful to know. Does it even have the context?

So, you know, communication is a human thing and we probably should talk about human to human communication as well as human to chat. But I fear that we're becoming lazy communicators. I. As we have these AI tools and people want the hacks and give me the library of prompts, and what that's doing is it's, diminishing people's capacity to think through what they wanna say before they say it.

So think about it like this, if all you use is a library of prompts that other people created, you are not exercising your mind to be a [00:22:00] creative communicator. You're just exercising your mind to be a cut and paste communicator and creative communicators run the world. Yeah. And so you, you know, learning to use ai, you know, really should challenge everyone to be the best possible communicator they can be.

Because, you know, AI is not emotional. And it doesn't read between the lines either. So you kind of Yeah. You know, become a creative communicator, not a cut and paste communicator. and the tools become so much more powerful. Yeah. and we all only do two things. Ronsley in business, every founder that's ever launched a product or service, there's only done one of two things, or both of them created or curated.

That's it. Mm-hmm. That's the sum total of business. And we've turned that into a product that only does two things. It makes the customer safe and it helps 'em win. The two things we're all selling is make the customer safe. Everyone wants to be made safe. No one wants to behave safely, like they wanna drink too [00:23:00] much or drive too fast, or smoke cigarettes or whatever, but they want someone else to make them safe.

So, make me safe and help me win. Help me get a better result than most other people get. in this context. So every business that's ever been built, created or curated or did both to make a solution that makes the customer safe and helps them win in the context of the problem a customer has. And so, you know, we, need to be creative communicators.

And so my first objective when I'm dealing with, you know, when I'm communicating with AI, is to create or curate a model that lets it understand what I want it to do. And then, go from there. there's a few other dimensions to this when you're dealing directly with a human or in one-to-one, one to many.

But, you know, we just, we've turned communication into an industry and yet, you know, we've missed so many of the basics as we've done that.
